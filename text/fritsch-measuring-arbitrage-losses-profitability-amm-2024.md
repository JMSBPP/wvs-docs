ABSTRACT
This paper presents the results of a comprehensive empirical study
of losses to arbitrageurs (following the formalization of loss-versus-
rebalancingby[Milionisetal.,2022])incurredbyliquidityproviders
on automated market makers (AMMs). We show that those losses
exceed the fees earned by liquidity providers across many of the
largest AMM liquidity pools (on Uniswap). Remarkably, we also
find that the Uniswap v2 pools are more profitable for passive LPs
than their Uniswap v3 counterparts.
Wealsoinvestigatehowarbitragelosseschangewithblocktimes.
As expected, arbitrage losses decrease when block production is
faster. However, the rate of the decline varies significantly across
different trading pairs. For instance, when comparing 100ms block
times to Ethereum’s current 12-second block times, the decrease
in losses to arbitrageurs ranges between 20% to 70%, depending on
the specific trading pair.

1 INTRODUCTION
Automated market makers (AMMs) have emerged as a cornerstone
ofdecentralizedfinance,holdingbillionsinliquidityandfacilitating
trillions in total trading volume. Ever since their inception, the
profitability of providing liquidity to AMMs has been a widely
discussed research topic – both in theory and in practice. The
central question remains: Do earnings from trading fees adequately
compensateliquidityproviders(LPs)onAMMsfortheriskstheyare
exposed to? The answer to this question is crucial, as the long-term
sustainability of AMMs, and by extension, much of decentralized
finance, relies heavily on LPs receiving sufficient compensation.
While earning trading fees, liquidity providers on AMMs face
adverse selection costs. Although any form of market-making ac-
tivity generally involves such costs, liquidity on AMMs is exposed
to a distinct form of losses to arbitrageurs that is unique to this
model. The prevalent type of AMM, the constant function market
maker (CFMM), by design, incurs a loss with each price movement
on external markets. The intuitive reason is that a CFAMM offers
to trade at an outdated (“stale”) price compared to continuous-time
off-chain markets at the beginning of each block. Arbitrageurs cap-
italize on this price difference, earning profits at the expense of the
AMM’s LPs.1
InaninfluentialcontributiontomeasuringLPprofitability,Milio-
nis et al. [15] formalized these losses to arbitrageurs by comparing
providing liquidity to an AMM with a rebalancing portfolio that

interact with the pool.
executes the same trades as an AMM position, but at the exter-
nal market price. They use a continuous-time model and propose
the term loss-versus-rebalancing (or short LVR) for the difference
between the value of the liquidity position and the rebalancing port-
folio. The concept offers a new angle to measuring LP profitability
by removing market risk since the rebalancing portfolio hedges the
position’s market risk.
Building upon this notion, a liquidity position can be deemed
as unprofitable if its earnings from fees fall short of the losses in-
curred to arbitrageurs. Note that, throughout this paper, we use
the expressions arbitrage losses, losses to arbitrageurs and arbitrage
profits interchangeably to refer to the losses that LPs suffer to arbi-
tragetradesduetooutdatedpricesontheAMM,orequivalently,the
profitsthatthearbitrageursmakeonthesetrades.Inthecontinuous-
time setting without AMM pool fees, this value aligns with LVR.
We extend this concept to the real-world setting characterized by
discrete trade times (whenever a new block is appended to the
blockchain) and AMM trading fees (similar to the theoretical model
in [14]).
In this paper, we empirically study the profitability of liquidity
provisionusinghistoricaldata.Inotherwords,wemeasurewhether
earnings from trading fees sufficiently compensate liquidity pro-
vided to AMMs for the incurred arbitrage losses. Our results also
quantify the potential benefits of some recently-suggested AMM
designs aiming to capture arbitrage profits for liquidity providers
(e.g. [11], [13] and [5]).
We compare the historical earnings from trading fees to the
amount of incurred arbitrage losses for the most-traded Uniswap
v2 and v3 pools. This covers a considerable fraction of the total
liquidityinAMMs,asUniswapv3isthemarket-leadingandhighest-
volume AMM on Ethereum. Uniswap v2, the market leader before
the introduction of v3, further maintains a substantial amount of
liquidity (about 70% as much as Uniswap v3, at the time of writing).
Fee earnings are computed based on the historical trading activity
within the liquidity pools. To simulate arbitrage losses, we assume
that the pools are consistently rebalanced to historical prices on
Binance, the most liquid cryptocurrency exchange.
Moreover, this paper also studies a proposed measure to reduce
LVR: the reduction of block times. To do so, we quantify how arbi-
trage losses depend on the time interval between blocks.
Our analysis reveals several notable findings. First, we confirm
what has previously been mostly known anecdotally: Fees do not
sufficiently compensate for arbitrage losses in most of the largest
Uniswap liquidity pools, i.e. historically, returns from fees have
been smaller than losses to arbitrageur. This result questions the
amount of liquidity (worth billions of USD at the time of writing)
currently provided to these AMM pools. On the other hand, we do
find some profitable pools among those with less-traded tokens.

Another noteworthy result is that Uniswap v2 pools, which the
more capital-efficient v3 pools have largely superseded, perform
remarkably well when comparing fees to arbitrage losses. In par-
ticular, the most-traded Uniswap v2 pools are significantly more
profitable than the corresponding Uniswap v3 pools for the same
pair and trading fee.
Lastly, we observe varying behavior in the relationship between
arbitrage losses and blockchain block times across trading pairs.
While faster block times, as expected, reduce losses for all studied
pairs, the extent and speed of the decline varies notably. We find
that losses to arbitrageurs are reduced by between 20% and 70%
with100msblocktimescomparedtoEthereum’scurrent12seconds,
depending on the trading pair.
2 RELATED WORK
The prevalent type of AMM utilized in DeFi today, i.e. the constant
product, or more broadly, constant function market maker, was ini-
tially discussed in 2016 [4], and later formalized in [3]. Specifically,
the AMMs analyzed in this study, namely versions v2 [1] and v3
[2] of the Uniswap protocol, are based on these concepts.
The profitability of liquidity on AMMs has been discussed since
early in their existence, focusing mostly on so-called “imperma-
nent loss” or “divergence loss”, which compares the development
of the value of a liquidity position to holding the liquidity outside
the AMM [16]. Empirically, the literature has studied the prof-
itability of liquidity providers (LPs) on automated market makers
across various AMMs, token pairs, and time frames. Heimbach et al.
[10] investigate LP’s behavior (and their profitability) on Uniswap
v2, while following works, such as [8, 9, 12], studied liquidity on
Uniswap v3.
In contrast, this paper follows the approach formalized by Mil-
ionis et al. [15] to measure LP performance versus a “rebalancing
portfolio”thathedgesthepriceriskoftheliquidityposition.Thepa-
peralsoincludesanempiricalmeasurementofLVRfortheUniswap
v2 WETH-USDC pool. Cartea et al. define predictable loss (PL), a
metric similar to LVR for quantifying LP losses, and measure it
for one Uniswap v3 WETH-USDC pool [6]. This work offers a
more comprehensive study, importantly including a wide range of
liquidity pools on Uniswap v3 – which has superseded v2 as the
market-leading AMM on Ethereum. Markout profits of Uniswap v3
liquidity, which are closely related to LVR, have been explored in
Twitter and blog posts, see e.g. [7], again for a limited set of pools. A
small subset of the results presented in this paper were previously
used in the empirical part of [5] which proposes an AMM design
utilizing batch auction to prevent LVR.
In follow-up work, Milionis et al. extend the model in Milionis
et al. [15] to incorporate discrete block times and positive AMM
fees [14]. In particular, their work provides theoretical predictions
for the relationship between block times and losses to arbitrageurs,
which we measure empirically. In the results section, we discuss in
detail how the theoretical and empirical results compare.
3 COMPARING FEES AND ARBITRAGE LOSSES
3.1 Methodology
For each liquidity pool we study, we consider a hypothetical liq-
uidity position existing from January 2022 to December 2023. We
calculate the fee that such a position would have earned using his-
torical trade data. We also simulate the arbitrage losses that the
liquidity position would incur, assuming the AMM pool is consis-
tently rebalanced to Binance prices, the most liquid centralized
exchange.
Uniswap v3 liquidity. In a simple constant-product liquidity pool
(such as Uniswap v2 pools), all liquidity positions are available over
the entire [0,∞] price range. Uniswap v3 pools, instead, employ
the concept of “concentrated liquidity”, that is, liquidity providers
can choose a specific price range they want to provide liquidity
to [2]. Within each range, liquidity positions act according to a
regular constant-product AMM. When a swap occurs, it is executed
only against liquidity provided around the price at which the swap
occurred. Correspondingly, the swap fees are distributed pro rata
among the liquidity available at that price.
For Uniswap v3 pools, we simulate a full-range liquidity position,
i.e., a position that provides liquidity the entire price range [0,∞],
as is the case for all Uniswap v2 positions. Note that, as long as
the price stays within the price range of a concentrated liquidity
position,itbehavessimilartoafull-rangeposition.Inparticular,the
concentrated position earns fees and incurs arbitrage losses in the
same way as a full-range position, but requires a smaller amount
of reserves to be deposited. This means that the returns from fees
as well as the arbitrage losses relative to the liquidity value scale
linearly with the concentration factor of a liquidity position, as
long as the position stays in range2.
Hence, our results, especially the ratios of fees and arbitrage
losses, are also relevant for general liquidity positions in v3 pools
as long as they do not go out of range.
Binance prices. We consider only Uniswap pools whose tokens
are traded on Binance. Moreover, ETH, BTC, USDC, and USDT are
traded directly against each other on Binance. For the remaining
pairs, i.e. LDO-ETH, LINK-ETH, MATIC-ETH, and UNI-ETH, we
derived the Binance prices by combining the prices of the two
corresponding USDT pairs.
For all Binance pairs, we retrieve second-by-second price data.
Then, for each Ethereum block, we consider the opening price in
the second determined by the block’s timestamp.
Finally, note that USDC was not traded on Binance between
September 2022 and March 2023.3 We substitute the missing data
by using the corresponding USDT pairs. We expect the effect of this
substitution on the results to be negligible since the prices of USDC
and USDT were (almost) equal during the periods we consider and
both were available on Binance.
Simulated losses to arbitrageurs. Using the price data from Bi-
nance, for each Uniswap pool, we simulate the amount of arbitrage
losses a full-range liquidity position would incur as follows. The
liquidity position is deposited into the pool at the beginning of the
observation period. Subsequently, at the time of each block (using
the timestamps of Ethereum blocks), we consider the external price
2A liquidity position that requires 𝑘-times less capital will experience 𝑘-times larges
fee returns and arbitrage losses relative to its value.
3During this period, Binance converted USDC and other stablecoins
to its own stablecoin, BUSD (see https://www.binance.com/en/support/
announcement/binance-to-auto-convert-usdc-usdp-tusd-to-busd-binance-usd-
e62f703604a94538a1f1bc803b2d579f).Measuring Arbitrage Losses and Profitability of AMM Liquidity
on Binance. If the difference to the current AMM pool price is suffi-
cient to create a profitable arbitrage opportunity between the pool
and the external market (i.e., Binance), we simulate the AMM (and
thereby the simulated position) being rebalanced by the optimal
arbitrage trade. That is, arbitrageurs trade with the pool until the
marginal price (taking fees into account), equals the Binance price.
In other words, we simulate an AMM that exclusively trades with
arbitrageurs. Note that we do not consider blockchain transaction
costs when determining profitable arbitrage opportunities. Since
we consider that the pool charges a trading fee, the price difference
needs to be larger than the fee for a profitable arbitrage opportunity
to exist.
The difference between the price at which the arbitrage trade is
executed (against the liquidity position) and the external price leads
to a profit for the arbitrageurs and a loss to liquidity providers. For
each arbitrage trade, we calculate the size of the loss relative to the
value of the liquidity position, and apply the loss to the liquidity
position in a compounding manner over time.
Historical fees. To compute historical returns from fees, we ex-
tract all swap transactions from Ethereum events. For each swap,
we retrieve the amount swapped, the fees paid, and the amount
of liquidity available at the swap’s price (more precisely, at the
marginal price after the swap). Then, by comparing the size of the
simulated position to the available liquidity, we can calculate the
amount of fees that the simulated position receives. We put this in
relation to the current position value to calculate the relative profit
and compound the profit into the liquidity position.4 Note that we
assume the size of the simulated position to be small compared
to the pool size, in the sense that its presence does not affect the
behavior of traders and other LPs.
This method of fee computation makes an implicit assumption,
namely that during a swap, the price stays within a price range
with constant liquidity. For Uniswap v3 pools, this can lead to
small inaccuracies when swaps cause large price movements, and
available liquidity varies across these price ranges. Besides these
potential inaccuracies being non-systematic, such situations are
expected to occur only rarely as we consider highly liquid pools
on Uniswap where the price impact of single swaps is generally
small.5
3.2 Results
Figure 1a shows the cumulative period-by-period difference be-
tween fees and arbitrage losses for a simulated full-range liquidity
position for the most liquid Uniswap v3 ETH and BTC pools. Down-
wards trending lines indicate fees consistently lower than arbitrage
losses over the two-year observation period. We observe this to
be the case for most ETH and BTC pools, including the highest-
traded Uniswap pool during most of the observation periods, the
WETH-USDC 5bp pool.
4In practice, fees automatically compound in Uniswap v2 pools while they do not in v3
pools. There, liquidity providers need to repeatedly add earned fees to their position
to achieve compounding.
5To illustrate this, we calculate that the difference between assuming liquidity to be
constant over a full block instead of over each swap is 0.01% over 6 months for the
WETH-USDC 0.05% pool. We expect the inaccuracies from assuming the liquidity to
be constant during each swap to be even smaller.

This fact can also be observed in Figure 1b, which shows the
30-day moving average of the period-by-period fees earned as a
percentage of arbitrage losses for a subset of the pools. For instance,
in the WETH-USDC 5bp pool, the historical returns from fees hover
around 80% of arbitrage losses.
The WETH-USDT 5bp pool (together with the WBTC-USDC
30bp pool) is an exception among the large pools in this regard,
roughly breaking even during most times. It also exhibits a brief
period in March 2023 when fees reached twice as high as losses due
to high trading volumes during the UDSC depeg in March 2023.
Figure 2 shows the corresponding results for several less traded
tokens. For these pairs, fees tend to compensate for arbitrage losses,
sometimes even being 50% higher on average, e.g. for the MATIC-
ETH and LINK-ETH pools.

3.3 Discussion
Our main result is that earnings from fees are smaller than losses to
arbitrageurs in the majority of the largest Uniswap pools, currently
holding hundreds of millions of USD. This result raises the question
of why LPs nevertheless contribute their capital to these pools.
Moreover, the results show the potential impact of mechanisms to
reduce LVR in AMMs on the profitability of AMM liquidity.
Finally, the fact that fees relative to the amount of (in-range)
liquidity are significantly higher for v2 pools compared to v3 pools,
even when comparing pools with equal fee tiers (0.3%) is arguably
surprising. On both types of AMMs, arbitrage losses are propor-
tional to the liquidity provided. The same would be true for retail
trading volume if these trades were routed optimally (assuming
trading fees are equal). However, larger pools (e.g., the v3 pools)
should see proportionally more volume when fixed costs per swap,
such as blockchain transaction fees, are taken into account. So the
ratio of fees to in-range liquidity, and thereby the returns from fees,
would be expected to be at least as large in v3 pools as in v2 pools.
One possible explanation for the difference in earnings from fees
could lie in an important distinction between Uniswap v3 and v2:
Uniswap v3 allows for competition between LPs. Its design enables

active LPs to move their liquidity around when prices change to
optimize their earning from fees, thereby possibly diminishing the
share of fees going to passive LPs who do not move their liquidity
position. The liquidity position considered in this work is passive,
meaning its earnings from fees could potentially suffer from this
competition.
4 LOSSES TO ARBITRAGEURS AND BLOCK
TIMES
The intuition behind shorter block times reducing losses to arbi-
trageurs is that smaller price differences between blocks lead to
smaller arbitrage opportunities. We quantify this effect for block
times between 100ms and 16s (and up to 5 min in the appendix).
4.1 Methodology
To simulate arbitrage losses under varying block times, we obtain
six months of Binance order book data (June 2023 to November
2023)6. More specifically, we download all updates to the best bid
6Note that Binance offers access to order book data only for perpetual futures, and
not for spot trading pairs. Hence, in this section, we consider the perpetual futureMeasuring Arbitrage Losses and Profitability of AMM Liquidity

logarithmic axes.
and ask prices, which allows us to deduce the current bid and
ask prices at arbitrary regular time intervals. Note that we do not
consider the amount of liquidity in the order book at these prices.
Instead, we implicitly assume arbitrageurs are able to buy and sell
sufficient amounts at the best bid and ask prices. The rationale
is that, with Binance being the most-liquid exchange, its prices
are in sync with the overall market, which offers sufficiently deep
liquidity.
We then simulate a hypothetical AMM position in a constant-
product pool for different block times between 100ms and 15s simi-
larly as described in the precious section: For each block time, we
assume that arbitrageurs rebalance the AMM pool at each every
block if it is profitable for them. This is the case if and only if the
current price on the AMM taking fees into account is below the
current best bid price or above the current best ask price.
We assume the pools to have the following trading fees, which,
at the time of writing, represent the most-common fee for these
prices for each of the pairs. See here for a description of Binance’s perpetual futures:

kinds of pairs on the most-used AMMs: 0.05% for ETH and BTC
pairs, and 0.3% for less-liquid “altcoin” pairs.
Note that the results do not depend on the size of the initial liq-
uidity position. Larger positions incur proportionally larger losses
to arbitrageurs leading to the same loss relative to the position’s
value.
## 4.2 Results
Our results (see Figures 4 and 5) show varying relationships be-
tween arbitrage losses and block times for different trading pairs.
Besides the overall magnitude of the losses, the manner of their
decline with shorter block times also varies across pairs. The re-
duction in losses to arbitrageurs when block time is 100ms block
(compared to Ethereum’s 12s), ranges between 20% and 70% de-
pending on the pair. For most token pairs, an acceleration in the
reduction trends can be observed for short block times.
The log-log plots in the lower figures show the general depen-
dence on block times. A slope of𝑐 in these plots would indicate that
arbitrage losses are proportional to the block interval to the powerRobin Fritsch and Andrea Canidio
of𝑐. The slope is about 1/3 for most pairs and block times above 1s,
while it is significantly flatter for blocks times shorter than 1s.
Finally, we see in Figures 4 and 5 that arbitrage losses begin
flattening out for longer block times. This effect can be seen even
more pronounced in Figure 6 in the appendix, which reports results
for up to 5 min block times. While the results are somewhat noisy,
they generally indicate arbitrage profits leveling off at about twice
the current rate at 12s block times for block intervals larger than 2
min.
4.3 Discussion
The relationship between arbitrage profits and block times has been
studied theoretically in [14]. For short block times, their theoretical
model predicts that arbitrage profits are proportional to the square
rootofthelengthoftheaverageblockintervals.Whileourempirical
findings come close to this model for most pairs and block times
larger than 1s, we observe a different regime for block times shorter
than 1s. More precisely, arbitrage profits appear to decline more
slowly than the theoretical model would suggest.
The deviating behavior could stem from the differences between
the theoretical model and our simulation setup. Firstly, their model
assumes blocks arrive according to a stochastic process while we
operate with fixed intervals between blocks. Secondly, the asset
prices are assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion whereas
base our analysis on historical price data.
On a related note, we remark that when examining arbitrage
losses for varying pool fees (simulated in the same way as for block
times), the simulation results match the expected inversely propor-
tional relationship predicted by [14] as Figure 7 in the appendix
shows.
5 CONCLUSION
To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the most compre-
hensive measurement of LP losses to arbitrageurs (LVR), spanning
multiple token pairs, AMM design, and also block time. We derive
several significant and somewhat surprising findings. Moreover, it
motivates further study in this direction of research.
First, we show that LPs contribute large amounts of liquidity
(worth billions USD) to AMMs despite losing to arbitrageurs more
than what they make in fees. This striking result begs the question
of why LPs contribute liquidity at all. Second, the difference in
profitabilitybetweenUniswapv2andv3poolsisstrikingandshould
be studied further, as it could reveal important insights on how to
design AMMs that are profitable (for LPs) and hence sustainable.
Finally, quantifying how LP losses to arbitrageurs change with the
intervals between trading opportunities can help to choose block
times when designing blockchains.
