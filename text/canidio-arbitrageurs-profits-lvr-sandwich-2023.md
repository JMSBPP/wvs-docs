Arbitrageurs’ profits, LVR, and sandwich
attacks: batch trading as an AMM design
response.∗

Abstract
We study a novel automated market maker design: the function maximizing AMM (FM-
AMM). Our central assumption is that trades are batched before execution. Because of
competition between arbitrageurs, the FM-AMM eliminates arbitrage profits (or LVR) and
sandwich attacks, currently the two main problems in decentralized finance and blockchain
design more broadly. We then consider 11 token pairs and use Binance price data to sim-
ulate the lower bound to the return of providing liquidity to an FM-AMM. Such a lower
bound is, for the most part, slightly higher than the empirical returns of providing liquidity
on Uniswap v3 (currently the dominant AMM).

Their popularity is largely due to their simplicity: each CFAMM processes trans-
actions sequentially as they appear on the blockchain, and the terms at which it
is willing to trade depend exclusively on its reserves. Because each trade changes
the composition of these reseves, different trades on the same CFAMM pay different
prices even if they are added to the blockchain simultaneously (i.e., within the same
block). The resulting pricing rule is discriminatory, in the sense that trading a large
amount in a single trade is equivalent to splitting the trade into smaller trades, each
paying a different price.
This market mechanism has two well-recognized flaws. First, CFAMMs trade
at a loss whenever there is a rebalancing event, in a way that is similar to the
“sniping” of stale quotes in traditional financial markets (Foucault, 1999). When
the underlying value of the assets changes, the first arbitrageur who trades with the
CFAMM will bring its marginal price (i.e., the price of an arbitrarily small trade)
in line with the equilibrium price. Because the price paid by the arbitrageur for
this trade differs from the equilibrium price, this arbitrageur earns infra-marginal
profits at the expense of the CFAMM’s liquidity providers (LPs). Second, traders are
routinely exploited by attackers, most commonly via sandwich attacks in which an
attacker front-runs a victim’s swap with a swap in the same direction and then back-
runs it with another swap in the opposite direction. Doing so allows the attacker to
“buy cheap” and “sell expensive” while forcing the victim to trade at less favorable
terms.
These flaws, in turn, generate a race between arbitrageurs and between attack-
ers in a way that is, again, akin to the high-frequency trading race in traditional
finance. These races are particularly worrisome in blockchain-based finance because
blockchains lack an objective notion of time: entities called validators have full dis-
cretion on the ordering of pending transactions to form the next block, hence deter-
mining their order of execution. As a consequence, arbitrageurs seeking to rebalance
an AMM compete by paying validators to have their transactions included earlier
in a block (similarly for attackers competing to sandwich a transaction). These
payments are usually intermediated by entities called builders, who are responsible
for ordering transactions to maximize total profits (which are called Maximal Ex-
tractable Value, or MEV). Because building blocks to extract maximum value is
a specialized activity with increasing returns to scale, the builders’ market is very
concentrated: currently, the top three builders produce approximately 80% of blocks
added to the Ethereum blockchain. These builders exert great control over which
transactions are included in the blockchain, therefore threatening the basic premise
of blockchain as a permissionless and decentralized system. As it turns out, arbi-
trage profits and sandwich attacks constitute more than 95% of MEV transactions:
without them, the benefit of delegating block construction to builders would be
minimal.2

Between October 2022 (when Ethereum changed its consensus protocol to proof of stake) to the1 Introduction 3
This paper proposes an AMM design that eliminates arbitrage profits and sand-
wich attacks, and hence the vast majority of MEV. We start by building on existing
literature (see the next section) in proposing an AMM design that processes transac-
tions in batches and uses uniform prices (unlike traditional CFAMMs which process
transactions sequentially and use discriminatory pricing). More precisely, we as-
sume that all trades that reach the AMM during a period are batched together and
executed at a price equal to the new marginal price on the AMM – that is, the price
of executing an additional small trade after the batch trades. We derive the trading
function of such an AMM and show two equivalences. First, the condition specifying
that the AMM trades at a price equal to the new marginal price can be interpreted
as the first-order condition of a maximization problem. Hence, for given prices, our
AMM trades to maximize a predetermined function of its reserves. For this reason,
we call our design a function-maximizing AMM, or FM-AMM. Second, if the func-
tion is the product of the two liquidity reserves and FM-AMM does not charge any
fee, its maximization implies that, for given prices, the value of the AMM’s reserves
is equally shared between the reserves assets. In other words, FM-AMM LPs run
an equal-weight passive investment strategy (or, in the language of Milionis et al.,
2022, a rebalancing strategy). Finally, we show that an FM-AMM does not satisfy
path independence: traders can obtain a better price by splitting their trades into
smaller orders, which is why batching is required.
Our main contribution is to study the behavior of an FM-AMM in the presence of
arbitrageurs who have private information about the equilibrium prices (determined,
for example, on some very liquid off-chain location). We show that competition
between arbitrageurs guarantees that the batch always trades at the equilibrium
price, and arbitrage profits are eliminated. Intuitively, if this were not the case, some
arbitrageurs would want to trade with the batch and, by doing so, would push the
price on the batch in line with the equilibrium. FM-AMM, therefore, changes who
benefits from arbitrageurs’ competition: as already discussed, competition between
CFAMM’s arbitrageurs generates MEV and benefits validators; competition between
FM-AMM’s arbitrageurs instead benefits its liquidity providers who “earn” what
would otherwise be MEV. An additional implication is that sandwich attacks are also
eliminated: arbitrageurs will always act to remove deviations from the equilibrium
price, making it impossible to manipulate the FM-AMM price. The intuition for
end of 2023, validators earned approximately 410,000 ETH in MEV (approximately 1.2 billion USD
at the current market price) For up-to-date statistics on total MEV, see https://transparency.
flashbots.net/. On the challenges MEV poses for blockchain design, see the Ethereum founda-
tion documentation (available here https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/). For up-
to-date statistics on the builders’ market, see here https://www.relayscan.io/overview?t=7d.
Several sources document how arbitrage profits and sandwich attacks constitute most of MEV; see,
for example, Appendix 13 in Heimbach et al. (2023). Note that sandwich attacks contribute to
the concentration in the builder market for an additional reason: as a defensive measure, a sophis-
ticated user may pay a builder to include a transaction in a block privately, preventing sandwich
attacks.1 Introduction 4
our main result is therefore similar to that in Budish et al. (2015), who show that
batching trades eliminates latency races in traditional finance by changing the nature
of competition between arbitrageurs. Our paper shows that the same solution can
be adapted to eliminate the malicious reordering of transactions in decentralized
finance.
We then propose a novel methodology to estimate LVR and the hypothetical
benefit of an FM-AMM for liquidity providers. We empirically analyze the return
of providing liquidity on Uniswap v3—currently the most important AMM with
a market share of about 50%—and compare it with a simulated counterfactual in
which the same liquidity was provided to an FM-AMM receiving zero noise trading.3
We collect Binance price data for 11 token pairs from April to October 2023. The 11
token pairs we consider correspond to the highest-volume Uniswap v3 pools during
the study period, excluding stable-coin to stable-coin pools and tokens not traded
on Binance. For each token pair, our simulated FM-AMM charges the same fee as
the corresponding Uniswap v3 pool. We assume that arbitrageurs can rebalance the
FM-AMM pool to the corresponding Binance price. Because of the fees, arbitrageurs
will not trade on the FM-AMM if the difference between the local and Binance prices
is sufficiently small. Also, when arbitrageurs trade, they will trade less than required
to rebalance the portfolio perfectly. Hence, a positive-fee FM-AMM always trades at
the correct price (and arbitrageurs’ profits are eliminated) but does not implement
a rebalancing strategy as in Milionis et al., 2022.
We compare the return on providing liquidity to this FM-AMM to the historical
returns of providing liquidity to the corresponding Uniswap v3 pool.4
Our results
generally support the benefit of providing liquidity to an FM-AMM: for 9 out of 11
token pairs, our simulated FM-AMM generates equal or higher returns than pro-
viding the same liquidity to Uniswap v3. The main exception is the MATIC-ETH
pool, where Uniswap v3 outperforms our simulated FM-AMM by 0.65%, which is
also the largest absolute difference in returns across all token pairs. Section 5.3 ex-
tends the empirical analysis to allow noise trading on the simulated FM-AMM. The
caveat is that, in our data, we do not know whether a given Uniswap transaction is
noise trading, a sandwich attack, or a rebalancing by an arbitrageur. We, therefore,
rely on previous work that measured the share of total volume attributable to each
3
The absence of noise trading allows us to establish a lower bound for the return of providing
liquidity to a more realistic FM-AMM with noise trading. We discuss in Section 5.3 how our
empirical results change under different assumptions about FM-AMM noise trading volume. Note
also that our theoretical model does consider the presence of noise traders.
4
Note that Uniswap v3 is characterized by concentrated liquidity: each LP provides liquidity over
a price range and earns returns only if the price is within that range. In our comparison, we use the
empirical distribution of liquidity and consider the return of an arbitrarily small non-concentrated
liquidity position (i.e., a position over the entire price range [0,∞]). For the FM-AMM, we also
assume a liquidity position that is non-concentrated. Also, when calculating the return of providing
liquidity to FM-AMM and Unsiwap v3, we assume that the fees earned are contributed back to
the AMM as additional liquidity (which is not the default behavior of Unsiwap v3).1 Introduction 5
source across all Uniswap v3 pools. Assuming these shares are the same for our
study pool, we can compute FM-AMM returns under different assumptions regard-
ing its noise-trading volume relative to Uniswap. In particular, we show that also
the FM-AMM MATIC-ETH pool outperforms the corresponding Uniswap v3 pool
if its noise trading volume is at least half of Uniswap v3 MATIC-ETH pool’s noise
trading volume.
Precisely estimating the additional efficiency of changing the market mechanism
from a traditional AMM to an FM-AMM is beyond the scope of the paper. We can,
however, provide some back-of-the-envelope estimations. First, there is the direct
benefit of eliminating sandwich attacks. On Ethereum alone, the cost generated by
these attacks was, on average, USD 500.000 daily in December 2023,5
or between 2.5
and 5 basis points of daily DEX volume on Ethereum. For reference, Aquilina et al.
(2022) finds that latency arbitrage in traditional financial markets imposes a roughly
0.5 basis point tax on trading. Second, eliminating arbitrage profits increases the
return of providing liquidity to an AMM. For a ballpark estimate of the size of this
increase, we use the results in Milionis et al. (2022) to estimate arbitrage profits
from price volatility. We calculate that, in 2023, eliminating arbitrage profits would
have added between 5 and 7 percentage points to the return of liquidity providers
in ETH/stable and BTC/stable pools with unconcentrated liquidity, and even more
for liquidity providers of other tokens (usually more volatile than ETH or BTC)
and for pools with concentrated liquidity. Because there are approximately USD 10
billion in non-stable-to-stable AMM pools, eliminating arbitrage profits would have
added between USD 0.5 and 1 billion to LPs profits in 2023.
To conclude this section, we want to stress that FM-AMM may, in the future, be
relevant also to traditional finance. There is a growing appreciation of the potential
benefit of exchanging traditional financial assets using blockchain-based AMMs, pri-
marily due to increased efficiency (i.e., the simultaneity of clearing and settlement)
and security. A case in point is the BIS Mariana project, testing the use of an AMM
for exchanging Central Bank Digital Currencies6
or the recent decision by Franklin
Templeton (one of the world’s largest fund managers) to launch a blockchain-based
money-market fund.7
In addition to these benefits, Malinova and Park (2023) cal-
culate that exchanging equities using a traditional AMM could save U.S. investors
about 30% of annual transaction costs, due to improved risk sharing and repurposing
of idle capital. By eliminating sandwich attacks and arbitrage profits, the FM-AMM
may help realize these benefits. A final observation is that at least two companies
started developing an FM-AMM by taking direct inspiration from earlier versions
of our paper, showing that some industry practitioners believe that FM-AMM may

have the benefits that our theory and empirical analysis predict.8
Relevant literature Several authors argued that AMM’s design allows arbitrageurs
to profit at the expense of LPs. Aoyagi (2020), Capponi and Jia (2021), Milionis
et al. (2022), and Milionis et al. (2023) provide theoretical models that illustrate this
possibility. In particular, Milionis et al. (2022) consider a continuous time model
with zero fees and derive a closed-form formula to measure LPs returns and the
cost they face when trading with informed arbitrageurs (which they call loss-vs-
rebalancing or LVR). Milionis et al. (2023) extend the analysis to blocks added at
discrete time intervals and strictly positive trading fees. They use the term arbi-
trageur profits to indicate LPs losses, a term we adopt because we also assume that
blocks are added at discrete time intervals and there may be non-zero fees. Capponi
and Jia (2021) show that arbitrageurs can exploit LPs even without asymmetric in-
formation. The reason is that the first arbitrageur trading with the pool can profit
at the expense of several LPs. Hence, this arbitrageur’s profits are larger than any
individual LPs loss and can always outspend (and trade before) any LP who may
want to withdraw their liquidity. Also related are Lehar and Parlour (2021) and
Foley et al. (2022), who argue that liquidity provision to AMMs is strategic: the
size of liquidity pools is smaller when arbitrageurs’ profits are higher. The intuition
is that when there is a rebalancing event, the loss to arbitrageurs per unit of liquidity
is independent of the size of the liquidity reserves. At the same time, the size of the
liquidity reserves determines the fraction of the revenues from noise traders earned
by each unit of liquidity. Hence, the endogenous response of liquidity providers
may explain why we find that fees from noise traders are approximately equal to
arbitrageurs’ profits in Uniswap v3.
A second important limitation of CFAMMs is that they enable sandwich attacks
(see Park, 2023). These attacks are quantitatively relevant. For example, Torres
et al. (2021) collected on-chain data from the inception of Ethereum (July 30, 2015)
until November 21, 2020, and estimated that sandwich attacks generated USD 13.9M
in profits. Qin et al. (2022) consider a later period (from December 1, 2018 to Au-
gust 5, 2021) and find that sandwich attacks generated USD 174.34M in profits. As
already mentioned, the data provider https://eigenphi.io/ on Ethereum mea-
sures in real-time the cost caused by sandwich attacks (measured as profits to the
attacker plus the payment to the validator for inclusion in the block) and currently
reports approximately USD 17 M for December 2023. Because an FM-AMM elimi-

The first company is CoW Protocol, the employer of one of the authors of this paper. CoW
Protocol collects trades into a batch and then runs an auction between entities called “solvers”
who compete to provide the best possible execution of these trades by accessing public AMMs,
private liquidity sources, or finding coincidence of wants (CoW) directly on the batch. It currently
intermediates more than 2 billion USD monthly. CoW Protocol recently launched an AMM inspired
by FM-AMM (see here https://cow.fi/cow-amm). The second is a startup called “sorella labs”
(see here https://twitter.com/SorellaLabs).1 Introduction 7
nates these attacks, our paper is part of the small but growing literature proposing
mechanisms to prevent malicious re-ordering of transactions by changing the design
of blockchain applications (vs. changing blockchain infrastructure); see Breidenbach
et al. (2018), Gans and Holden (2022), Canidio and Danos (forthcoming), Ferreira
and Parkes (2023).
Several initial discussions on designing “surplus maximizing” or “surplus captur-
ing” AMMs occurred informally on blog and forum posts (see Leupold, 2022, Josojo,
2022, Della Penna, 2022). The idea of an AMM that accepts trades from a batch
is already in Ramseyer et al. (2023) and Johnson et al. (2023). In particular, Ram-
seyer et al. (2023) derive several possible trading rules for such AMM, one of which
corresponds to the FM-AMM (trading rule U). The FM-AMM pricing function is
also studied in Park (2023), who calls it uniform pricing AMM. He also shows that
such an AMM violates path independence because it generates the incentives to
split trades.9
Relative to these works, our main contribution is to study FM-AMM
in a context with privately informed arbitrageurs. Competition between these arbi-
trageurs guarantees that the FM-AMM always trades at the “correct” equilibrium
price, eliminating arbitrage profits and sandwitch attacks. Finally, Schlegel and
Mamageishvili (2022) study AMM from an axiomatic viewpoint. In particular, they
discuss path independence, which FM-AMMs violate.
Several authors studied whether providing liquidity on AMMs, and in particular,
on Uniswap, is profitable; see Heimbach et al. (2021), Loesch et al. (2021), Heimbach
et al. (2022). The main difference between these papers and ours is that we com-
pare Uniswap LP returns to a different benchmark (here, the return of contributing
liquidity to a positive-fee FM-AMM, in those papers, a holding strategy). In this
respect, our strategy is similar to the empirical analysis in Milionis et al. (2022), who
find that for the ETH-USDC Uniswap v2 pool, the losses to arbitrageurs are smaller
than the revenues from noise traders. The main difference with our analysis is in
the benchmark against which we compare Uniswap LPs returns. In Milionis et al.
(2022), the benchmark is a rebalancing strategy, equivalent to providing liquidity to
a zero-fee FM-AMM. Instead, we consider an FM-AMM with the same fee as the
corresponding Uniswap pool. This implies that if the reference Uniswap pool is not
rebalanced because its fees are too high relative to the price movement, the same
applies to our benchmark FM-AMM. Another difference is in the implementation of
the benchmark, which, in our case, is not a theoretical construct but an alternative
AMM design. Finally, we study several Uniswap v3 pools.
Our paper is closely related to the literature studying batch auctions in tradi-
tional finance. In particular, the intuition for our main result is closely related to
Budish et al. (2015), who study the batching of trades in the context of traditional
9
In an earlier paper, Forgy and Lau (2021) studies a family of AMM pricing functions, one of
which corresponds to the FM-AMM. However, they do not discuss the issue of trade splitting or
batching.2 The function-maximizing AMM 8
finance as a way to mitigate the high-frequency-trading (HFT) arms race and pro-
tect regular (or slow) traders. The main result is that when trading happens in
continuous time, arbitrageurs compete on speed. When traders are instead batched
(that is, collected over a given time interval and then settled), arbitrageurs compete
on price because the priority of execution within the batch is given based on price.
The intuition in our model is similar, although competition between arbitrageurs
on the batch is rather in quantity than in price: if the price on an FM-AMM differs
from the equilibrium price, competing arbitrageurs will submit additional trades to
exploit the available arbitrage opportunity, but by doing so, they push the price on
the FM-AMM in line with the equilibrium. See also Aquilina et al. (2022), who
estimates the cost of high-frequency trading races. Also relevant is an older liter-
ature comparing batch trading with continuous time double auction and showing
that batch trading reduces the inefficiencies due to the presence of informed traders
(Madhavan, 1992) and reduces the cost of intermediation by allowing traders to
trade with each other directly (Nicholas and Schwartz, 1995). Finally, our work is
in the spirit of literature studying how to design real-world markets (as in Roth,
2002). In particular, Roth and Xing (1997) studies the benefit of batch processing
over sequential processing but focuses on a very different market.
We conclude by noting that an FM-AMM is also an oracle: it exploits compe-
tition between arbitrageurs to reveal on-chain the price at which these arbitrageurs
can trade off-chain. It is, therefore, related to the problem of Oracle design (as
discussed, for example, by Chainlink, 2020).
Outline The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
introduce the FM-AMM in its simplest form with a product function and zero fees.
In Section 3, we discuss several extensions, including fees and the fact that an
FM-AMM violates path dependence and hence requires batching. In Section 4, we
consider the behavior of an FM-AMM in the equilibrium of a game with informed
arbitrageurs and noise traders. Section 5 contains the empirical analysis. Section 6
discusses the threat model, that is, what happen when the entity that manages the
batching process is malicious. The last section concludes.
## 2 The function-maximizing AMM
In this section, we first introduce the main concepts of interest using a simple
constant-product function (both for the CFAMM and the FM-AMM), no fees, and
keeping formalities to the minimum. In the next section, we generalize our defini-
tions and results and introduce additional elements.
As a preliminary step, we derive the trading function of a constant product
AMM, the simplest and most common type of CFAMM. Suppose that there are
two assets, ETH and DAI. A constant product AMM (CPAMM) is willing to trade2 The function-maximizing AMM 9

Fig. 1: Initially, the liquidity reserves of the CPAMM are Y and X. A trader then

trade) is p̂ ̸= pCPAMM
(x).
ETH for DAI (or vice versa) as long as the product of its liquidity reserves remains
constant (see Figure 1 for an illustration). Call Y and X its initial liquidity reserves
in DAI and ETH, respectively, and pCPAMM
(x) the average price at which the
CPAMM is willing to trade x ETH, where x > 0 means that CPAMM is selling
ETH while x < 0 means that the CPAMM is buying ETH. For the product of the
liquidity reserves to be constant, it must be that
Y · X = (Y + pCPAMM
(x) · x)(X − x)
or
pCPAMM
(x) =
Y
X − x
.
Note that the marginal price of a CPAMM (i.e., the price to trade an arbitrarily small
amount) is equal to the ratio of its liquidity reserves. The key observation is that, in
a CPAMM, a trader willing to trade x pays a price different from the marginal price
after the trade. This is precisely the reason why arbitrageurs can exploit a CPAMM:
an arbitrageur who trades with the CPAMM to bring its marginal price in line with
some exogenously determined equilibrium price does so at an advantageous price
(and hence makes a profit at the expense of the CPAMM LPs).2 The function-maximizing AMM 10
Instead, in the introduction, we defined an FM-AMM as an AMM in which, for
every trade, the average price equals the marginal price after the trade – a prop-
erty we call clearing-price consistency. For ease of comparison with the CPAMM
described earlier, suppose that the FM-AMM function is the product of the two
liquidity reserves. If its marginal price is, again, the ratio of its liquidity reserves,
then the AMM is clearing-price consistent if and only if its price function p(x) is
p(x) =
Y + x · p(x)
X − x
,
where the RHS of the above expression is the ratio of the two liquidity reserves after
the trade. Solving for p(x) yields:
pFM−AMM
(x) ≡ p(x) =
Y
X − 2x
,
which implies that the FM-AMM’s marginal price is, indeed, the ratio of the liquidity
reserves. Hence, a given trade on the FM-AMM generates twice the price impact
than the same trade on the traditional CPAMM (cf. the expression for pCPAMM
(x)).
Interestingly, an FM-AMM can also be seen as a price-taking agent maximizing
an objective function. If its objective function is the product of the two liquidity
reserves, then for a given price p the FM-AMM supplies x ETH by solving the
following problem:
xFM−AMM
(p) = argmaxx {(X − x)(Y + p · x)}.
It is easy to check that the FM-AMM supply function is:
xFM−AMM
(p) =
1

.
Hence, to purchase x ETH on the FM-AMM, the price needs to be, again:
pFM−AMM
(x) =
Y
X − 2x
.
It follows that, whereas a traditional CPAMM always trades along the same curve
given by Y · X, the FM-AMM trades as to be on the highest possible curve. With
some approximation, we can see an FM-AMM as a traditional CPAMM in which
additional liquidity is added with each trade. See Figure 2 for an illustration.
A final observation is that the FM-AMM’s trading function is equivalent to
p · (X − xFM−AMM
(p)) = Y + p · xFM−AMM
(p).
In other words, for a given p, the values of the two liquidity reserves are equal after
the trade. Therefore, an FM-AMM with product function trades to implement a3 Additional considerations 11

passive investment strategy, in which the total value of the two reserves is equally
split between the two assets (that is, a passive investment strategy with weights 1/2,
1/2). It is easy to check that the FM-AMM can implement any passive investment
strategy with fixed weights (α,1 − α) by specifying the objective function as (X −

.
## 3 Additional considerations
## 3.1 Generalization of definitions and results
We now generalize our results. We define an AMM as an entity that accepts or
rejects trades based on a pre-set rule. Such a rule can be derived from the AMMs
liquidity reserves (Y,X) ∈ R2
+ and the AMM function Ψ : R2
+ → R. We assume
that the AMM function is continuous, it is such that Ψ(Y,0) = Ψ(0,X) = Ψ(0,0)
for all Y X, that it is strictly increasing in both its arguments whenever Y > 0 and
X > 0, and that it is strictly quasiconcave. The difference between different types of
AMMs is how the function Ψ(.,.) and the liquidity reserves (Y,X) determine what3 Additional considerations 12
trades will be accepted and rejected by the AMM.
Definition 1 (Constant Function Automated Market Maker). For given liquidity
reserves (Y,X) and function Ψ : R2
+ → R, a constant function automated market
maker (CFAMM) is willing to trade x for y = p(x) · x if and only if
Ψ(Y + p(x) · x,X − x) = Ψ(Y,X).
Our first goal is to define an AMM that is clearing-price-consistent in the sense
that, for every trade, the average price of the trade equals the marginal price after
the trade.
Definition 2 (Clearing-Price Consistent AMM). For given liquidity reserves (Y,X)
and function Ψ : R2

Note that, given our assumptions on Ψ(.,.), whenever Y > 0 and X > 0, the
marginal price is strictly increasing in the first argument and strictly decreasing in
the second argument, converges to zero as X → ∞ or Y → 0, and to infinity as
X → 0 or Y → ∞.
We also define a function-maximizing AMM (FM-AMM) that maximizes the
objective function instead of keeping it constant:
Definition 3 (Function-Maximizing AMM). For given liquidity reserves (Y,X) and
function Ψ : R2
+ → R, a function-maximizing AMM is willing to trade x for y =
p(x) · x if and only if p(x) = x−1
(p), where
x(p) := argmaxx {Ψ(Y + p · x,X − x)}. (2)
The next proposition establishes the equivalence between clearing-price-consistent
and function-maximizing AMMs.
Proposition 1. For given liquidity reserves (Y,X) and function Ψ : R2
+ → R, an
AMM is function maximizing if and only if it is clearing-price consistent.
Proof. Under our assumptions, solving (2) is equivalent to satisfying the first-order
condition, which is equivalent to (1).3 Additional considerations 13
## 3.2 Path-dependence (or why batching trades is necessary)
CFAMMs are path-independent: splitting a trade into multiple parts and executing
them sequentially does not change the average price of the trade. This property
does not hold for an FM-AMM because traders can get better prices by splitting
their trade. In fact, by splitting their trade into arbitrarily small parts, traders pay
approximately the same price as on the corresponding CFAMM. This is why an
FM-AMM’s trading function can be implemented only if trades are batched.
To see this, note trading x on an FM-AMM with product function changes the
reserves as follows:
(Y,X) →

Y

X − x
X − 2x

,X − x

.
If instead we split the trade into smaller parts

i=1 xi = x and execute them
sequentially, the FM-AMM reserves will change to

which equals the DAI reserve of a CPAMM after a trade x. Hence, to have an
FM-AMM, it is necessary to prevent splitting orders by imposing the batching of
trades.10
## 3.3 Batching
In what follows, we assume that the FM-AMM enforces batching by collecting in-
tentions to trade off-chain and settling them on-chain each block. Trades in opposite
directions are settled peer-to-peer, and the excess is settled on the FM-AMM as a
single trade. Importantly, all trades belonging to the same batch face the same prices
before fees (the next section discusses the role of fees).11
We can, therefore, think
of batching as an off-chain component of the AMM, together with, for example, its
UI.
10
It is still possible that trades are split across batches. Whether this is profitable depends on
who else is trading with the FM-AMM, which is a problem with the study in the next section.
11
This process is modeled around CoW Protocol (www.cow.fi). CoW Protocol collects intentions
to trade off-chain and executes them as a batch. Cow Protocol enforces uniform clearing prices so
that all traders in the same batch face the same prices. Also, all intention-to-trade collected by
CoW Swaps for inclusion in its batch are visible to all market participants.3 Additional considerations 14
The fact that batching is done off-chain introduces a trust assumption, which we
discuss in Section 6. However, it is important to note that, in the future, there may
be other ways to enforce batching, some of which remove this off-chain component.
For example, if the FM-AMM is built on Ethereum, batching could be enforced
by leveraging proposer-builder separation (or PBS). In PBS, block builders (enti-
ties that assemble transactions in a block that are then forwarded to a proposer
for inclusion in the blockchain) could compute the net trades that will reach the
FM-AMM during that block and include a message at the beginning of the block
announcing this value. The FM-AMM, then, uses this message to compute the price
at which all trades will be executed. If the proposer’s announcement turns out to
be correct at the end of the block, the FM-AMM will reward the builder (punish-
ments can also be introduced if the block builder report is incorrect, see Leupold,
2022). An alternative is to use an application-specific layer 2 blockchain (or app
chain): a blockchain designed to operate one specific application, and that settles
on an underlying blockchain (for example, Ethereum) at regular intervals. How to
do batching in an app-chain is an area of active research.
## 3.4 Fees
To study the possibility that FM-AMM charges fees, we first consider the case where
all orders on the batch have the same sign (that is, all orders are either buy or sell).
We then extend the analysis to the case in which there could be both buy and
sell orders on the batch, and hence the FM-AMM has both a buy and a sell price.
For ease of comparison with Uniswap (the most important and liquid CFAMM), we
assume that the fee is paid in the sell tokens, that is, the input token from the AMM
perspective. The fee collected accrues within FM-AMM as additional liquidity.12
Either buy or sell orders on the batch. Suppose there is a fee τ ∈ (0,1). If x < 0
(i.e., the batch sells ETH to the FM-AMM), then a fraction of the sell amount is
captured as fees, and the rest is traded on the FM-AMM. The traders on the batch
therefore receive (1 − τ) · pFM−AMM
(x(1 − τ)) DAI for each ETH that they sell to
the FM-AMM. If instead x > 0 (i.e., the batch purchases ETH from the FM-AMM),
then again a fraction of the sell amount (in this case, DAI) is captured by the FM-
AMM as fees. It follows that the traders on the batch pay pFM−AMM
(x)/(1 − τ)
DAI for each ETH that they buy from the FM-AMM. For x ̸= 0, we can therefore
12
FM-AMM, therefore, behaves similarly to Uniswap V1 and V2. On Unsiwap V3, however, the
default behavior is that fees accrue outside the AMM. Nonetheless, in our empirical estimation of
the return of providing liquidity to Uniswap V3, we will assume that the fees earned are returned
to the AMM as additional liquidity.3 Additional considerations 15
define the FM-AMM effective price as

(1−τ)
−2x
if x < 0
(3)
The terms X/(1−τ) and Y/(1−τ) have an intuitive interpretation: the fee causes
the FM-AMM to behave as if it had more of the token that traders want to sell to
the FM-AMM. This also implies that the fee τ affects the elasticity of the effective
price to the size of the trade |x|, with a higher fee implying a larger price impact.
A final observation is that a positive-fee FM-AMM remains a function maximiz-
ing AMM, but the objective of the maximization depends on the sign of the trade.
We can therefore write p̃(x,τ) = x−1
(p,τ) and
x(p,τ) = argmaxx {U(x,p,τ)}
where

Both buy and sell orders on the batch. Suppose now that there are both buy
and sell orders on the batch. In this case, some orders are settled peer-to-peer, while
other orders may be settled on the FM-AMM. All orders will have the same price
before fees but different buy and sell prices after fees.
The key observation is that the price before fees depends on the trade occurring
on the FM-AMM. We denote an individual order by xi, and the net trade reaching
the FM-AMM by x. Again, if x < 0, then only x(1 − τ) is exchanged on the FM-
AMM, and the price before fee is pFM−AMM
(x(1 − τ)). If instead x > 0, the full
amount is exchanged on the FM-AMM and the price before fee is pFM−AMM
(x).
Given the price before fee, the sign of an order xi determines its effective price,
which is
p̃(x,xi,τ) ≡

(5)
See also Figure 4. It is easy to check that if xi and x have the same sign, then the
above expression is identical to (3). The above equation is, therefore, a generaliza-
tion of (3). Also, some trades may be settled peer-to-peer even if x = 0 and no trade4 The model 16

is settled on the FM-AMM. The above expression implies that the price before fees
when x = 0 is Y/X, which is the same as in a standard CPAMM such as Uniswap.
Finally, note that for given τ, the revenues earned by trades that are settled peer-
to-peer is an exogenous transfer that does not affect the FM-AMM maximization
of (4). Hence, like in the previous case, FM-AMM remains “function maximizing”:
for any given p and τ it trades so to maximize (4) and move “up the curve” (as in
Figure 3).
## 4 The model
Equipped with the full description of an FM-AMM, we can now study its behavior in
an environment with traders and arbitrageurs. We limit our analysis to the product
function.4 The model 17

The timing is continuous. Every µ second, a new block is added to the blockchain.
Traders can submit trades for inclusion in the batch anytime between the addition
of a new block until γ ∈ (0,µ) seconds before the addition of the next block, where
γ is typically much smaller than µ (See Figure 5). These trades are then settled in
the next block. The batch settles trades peer-to-peer whenever possible, and the
excess is settled on the FM-AMM. All trades on the same batch pay the same price
before the fee and also the same fee (c.f., Section 3.4). All trades submitted for
inclusion in the batch are observable.
There are two types of traders: noise traders and arbitrageurs. In the batch
preceding block i ∈ {1,2,...}, each of n noise traders submits a market order aj(i)
for j ∈ {1,2,...,n} to the FM-AMM, with the convention that if aj(i) > 0 then noise
trader j buys aj(i) ETH, while if aj(i) < 0 then noise trader j sells |aj(i)| ETH.13
We also denote by a+(i) ≡
Pn
j=1 max{aj(i),0} and a−(i) ≡
Pn
j=1 min{aj(i),0} the
13
The fact noise traders submit market orders also implies that each
P
j aj(i) is small relative
to the FM-AMM liquidity reserves. Otherwise, trading on the FM-AMM could have a large price
impact, and we should treat orders from noise traders as limit orders. In this case, all our results
continue to hold at the cost of additional notation.4 The model 18

a+(i) + a−(i) their net demand.
Besides noise traders, there are a large number of identical, cash-abundant, risk-
neutral, competing arbitrageurs who can trade as part of the batch and on some
external trading venue, assumed much larger and more liquid than the combination
of noise traders and the FM-AMM. The equilibrium price for ETH on this external
trading venue at time t is p∗
(t) and is unaffected by trades on the FM-AMM. Arbi-
trageurs aim to profit from price differences between the FM-AMM and the external
trading venues. Arbitrage opportunities will be intertemporal (over short intervals).
Hence, for ease of derivations, we assume that arbitrageurs do not discount the fu-
ture. Finally, the parameter γ measures latency because it implies that arbitrageurs
can use information up to i · µ − γ when submitting trades on the batch that will
settle on block i.14
We assume that the equilibrium price p∗
(t) is a continuous-time
martingale. This assumption guarantees that the expectation of future prices is the
current price; that is, for every t′
> t′′
, we have Et′′[p∗
(t′
)] = p∗
(t′′
) (where the
expectation is taken with respect to the information available in period t′′
).
We are now ready to derive our main proposition.
Proposition 2. Suppose that, at the end of block i−1, the reserves of the FM-AMM
are X and Y . Then, in the unique pure strategy equilibrium, in the subsequent batch:
• If p∗
(µ·i−γ) > 1
(1−τ)
pFM−AMM
(a(i)) or p∗
(µ·i−γ) < (1−τ)pFM−AMM
(a(i)),
then the arbitrageurs submit trade r∗
(i) such that
p̃(a(i) + r∗
(i),r∗
(i),τ) = p∗
(µ · i − γ),
In this case, we say that there is a rebalancing event.
14
For ease of exposition, we assume that arbitrageurs have no latency, but the batch has latency
γ. We could introduce a latency parameter for arbitrageurs and a different latency parameter for
the batch, in which case γ is the total latency.4 The model 19
• Otherwise, there is no rebalancing event, and arbitrageurs submit no trade,
that is, r∗
(i) = 0.
The formal proof of the proposition is in Appendix A. It is based on the ob-
servation that, because of competition between arbitrageurs, there cannot be any
arbitrage opportunity left unexploited in equilibrium. If
p∗
(µ · i − γ) >
1
(1 − τ)
pFM−AMM
(a(i)) or p∗
(µ · i − γ) < (1 − τ)pFM−AMM
(a(i)),
then this intuition implies that arbitrageurs will rebalance the FM-AMM, that is,
they will trade on FM-AMM until its effective price (as faced by the arbitrageurs)
is exactly p∗
(µ·i−γ), which is also the expected price when the next block will be
added to the blockchain. If instead
p∗
(µ · i − γ) ∈

(1 − τ)pFM−AMM
(a(i)),

(1 − τ)

(a(i))

,
then arbitrageurs cannot trade on the batch and make a profit because, given the
trades submitted by noise traders, the buy price on the batch is higher than the
equilibrium price, and the sell price on the batch is lower than the equilibrium
price.
To conclude this section, we discuss how the FM-AMM performs in the presence
of risk. Consider period µ(i − 1), when block i − 1 is added to the blockchain.
At that point in time, the future price p∗
(µ · i − γ) is a random variable with
E[p∗
(µ·i−γ)] = p∗
(µ(i−1)). In a traditional CFAMM, we know from the literature
that arbitrage profits increase in the volatility of the price (see Capponi and Jia,
2021, Milionis et al., 2022, and Milionis et al., 2023). The intuition is that higher
price volatility implies larger and more frequent trades by arbitrageurs. Hence, in
a CFAMM, the expected value of future LP holdings is lower when, from period
µ·(i−1) viewpoint, the variance of p∗
(µ·i−γ) is higher: a CFAMM is risk-averse
in the value of its reserves. However, the previous proposition shows that FM-AMM
trades with arbitrageurs at the expected equilibrium price. Hence, absent noise
traders, FM-AMM is risk-neutral in the value of its reserves.15
At the same time, we discussed earlier how a CFAMM always trades to stay on
the same function, while an FM-AMM trades to increase the value of its function.
15
The presence of noise traders slightly complicates this logic: if there is a rebalancing event,
noise traders who trade in the same direction as arbitrageurs also trade at the expected equilibrium
price, while all other noise traders trade at a price that is a linear transformation of the equilibrium
price. If there is no rebalancing event, then the price at which noise traders trade is independent
of the equilibrium price. The revenues earned from noise traders are, therefore, piecewise linear
in the equilibrium price: they are linear if there is a rebalancing event, but they are flat if there
is no rebalancing. They are neither globally concave nor globally convex, making it impossible to
make a general statement about how revenues from noise traders are affected by the volatility of
the equilibrium price.5 Empirical analysis 20
More precisely, for given prices and fee, FM-AMM trades to maximize the objective
function U(x,p,τ), defined in (4). The next proposition shows that this increase
is larger the more risk there is. Hence, with respect to the value of the function,
a CFAMM is risk-neutral (i.e. it always stays on the same function), while an
FM-AMM is risk-loving.
Proposition 3 (FM-AMM is risk loving). Consider two probability distributions for
the equilibrium price in period µ · i − γ, F(p) : R+
→ [0,1] and G(p) : R+
→ [0,1]
having equal mean p∗
(µ(i − 1)). Assume that F() is a mean-preserving spread of
G(), that is, it is possible to write
p∗
f = p∗
g + ϵ
where p∗
f ∼ F(), p∗
g ∼ G() and ϵ is a shock with E[ϵ|p∗
g] = 0. Then, in expectation
from period µ(i − 1) viewpoint, the FM-AMM reaches a higher function in period
µ · i under distribution F() than under distribution G(), that is
EF [V (p̃(a(i) + r∗
(i),τ),τ)|t = µ(i − 1)] ≥ EG[V (p̃(a(i) + r∗
(i),τ),τ)|t = µ(i − 1)]
where V (p,τ) = maxx U(x,p,τ). The inequality is strict if the probability of a
rebalancing under distribution F() is strictly positive.
See Appendix A for the proof. The proposition compares the expected value of
the function under two distributions of the future price, where one distribution is a
mean-preserving spread of the other. This ranking captures an intuitive notion of
risk because one distribution can be derived from the other by adding some noise. If
one distribution is a mean-preserving spread of another, the former distribution has a
higher variance. Note that not all distributions can be ranked using mean-preserving
spreads. However, it is usually the case that if both distributions belong to the same
family (i.e., both normal), then ranking based on mean-preserving spreads coincides
with the ranking based on variance.
## 5 Empirical analysis
We complement our theoretical analysis by estimating the returns of providing liq-
uidity to an FM-AMM. We do so by considering a counterfactual in which an FM-
AMM existed during a specific period. We use Binance price data (together with
our theoretical results) to simulate how arbitrageurs would have rebalanced our sim-
ulated FM-AMM. For the moment, we assume that there are no noise traders on the
FM-AMM (that is a−(i) = a+(i) = 0 for all i) and postpone to Section 5.3 the case
of an FM-AMM that also receives noise traders. Hence, the estimated LP returns
derived here should be considered the lower bound to the possible returns generated5 Empirical analysis 21
by an FM-AMM earning revenues from noise traders. Also, we assume zero latency
(that is, γ = 0).16
We then compare the return of providing liquidity to our simulated FM-AMM to
the empirical returns of providing liquidity to the corresponding Uniswap v3 pool. In
this case, we assume that FM-AMM has the same fee as the corresponding Uniswap
v3 pool and the batch frequency is 1 block. Because the simulated FM-AMM is
not exploited by arbitrageurs but does not earn revenues from noise traders, this
comparison establishes whether, on the Uniswap v3 pool we consider, arbitrageurs’
profits exceed or fall short of the revenues generated by noise traders. After precisely
simulating an FM-AMM’s returns without noise trading, we estimate the amount of
noise trading volume (relative to Uniswap’s volume) that an FM-AMM would need
to receive to outperform Uniswap v3 on all pairs. Finally, we study how the returns
of FM-AMM LPs change with its fees.
## 5.1 Details of the empirical analysis
We select the top Uniswap v3 pools by trading volume from April 2023 to October
2023, excluding stablecoin pairs and tokens not traded on Binance, for a total of 11
pools. Among those, the highest-volume pairs are WETH and WBTC exchanged
with each other or with a stablecoin (7 pools), followed by less-traded tokens ex-
changed with WETH (4 pools).
For the same period and token pairs, we retrieve second-by-second price data
from Binance. Note that on Uniswap, most tokens trade against either WETH
or USDC. Instead, on Binance, almost all tokens trade against USDT, and only a
few against USDC.17
As a consequence, for the most liquid token pairs we can use
Binance prices directly, while for the less liquid token pairs we derive the Binance
price of a token in ETH by combining the Binance prices of that token in USDT with
the Binance price of ETH in USDT. The implicit assumption is that arbitrageurs
can trade on multiple Binance markets. Proposition 2 then allows us to compute
the size and direction of the trade that would have rebalanced an FM-AMM to the
Binance price. These rebalancing trades determine the evolution of the FM-AMM
reserves and the return of its liquidity providers.
Then, for each of our selected Uniswap v3 pools, we calculate the return of a
simulated unconcentrated liquidity position (i.e., a position over the entire price
range [0,∞]). Note that on Uniswap v3, a liquidity position can be concentrated,
meaning that the liquidity is available only over a certain price range. Also, when
16
Introducing positive latency would not change our result but add noise to our estimation.
17
Furthermore, USDC was unavailable on Binance between September 2022 and March
2023 because, during this period, Binance would automatically convert all USDC deposits
into its own stablecoin BUSD (see https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/
binance-to-auto-convert-usdc-usdp-tusd-to-busd-binance-usd-e62f703604a94538a1f1bc803b2d579f).
For this reason, we start our time series in April 2023.5 Empirical analysis 22
a swap occurs, the fees collected are distributed proportionally among the liquidity
available around the price at which the swap occurred. Therefore, to compute the
fees earned by our simulated liquidity position, we retrieve all swap transactions on
the pool in question from an Ethereum node. For each of these swaps, we collect
data on the fee paid and the liquidity available around the price just after the swap.
We can then calculate the fees our simulated liquidity position would have earned.
Our method is based on three assumptions. First, the simulated liquidity posi-
tion is too small to affect traders’ incentives to trade and other LPs’ incentives to
provide liquidity. Second, we implicitly assume that the price stays within the same
ticks during a swap transaction. This is inaccurate because when a swap causes
a large price movement, a part of the fee is shared among the liquidity available
around the initial price (and not only around the final price). If the liquidity avail-
able at the initial price is less (more) than that available at the final price, then
our method underestimates (overestimates) the fees earned by our liquidity posi-
tion, leading to some non-systematic inaccuracies in our estimation.18
Third, we
assume that the fees earned by our simulated liquidity position are automatically
and costlessly contributed to the pool as additional liquidity. However, on Uniswap
v3, fees accrue outside the AMM. Using them as additional liquidity is possible by
exchanging a fraction of the fees earned (in a single token) in the other tokens and
then contributing them as liquidity. This generates gas costs and additional AMM
fees, which we ignore in our calculation. Our method, therefore, overestimates the
return of providing liquidity on Uniswap v3
Finally, our results do not depend on the size of the initial liquidity position.
On Uniswap v3, a larger initial position earns proportionally more fees, but its ROI
is the same. Similarly, on an FM-AMM, the size of the rebalancing trade scales
proportionally with the available liquidity so that, again, its ROI is independent
of its initial size. Also, as already discussed, for both Uniswap v3 and the FM-
AMM, we consider a non-concentrated liquidity position. If both positions are
concentrated in the same (symmetrical) way, both Uniswap v3 fees and FM-AMM
returns increase by the same factor as long as the price does not go out of range. So
the comparison does not change, and the full-range comparison already constitutes
a general comparison.
## 5.2 Results
Arbitrageurs’ profits vs. Uniswap fees Figure 6 shows the difference in cumu-
lative returns between a simulated FM-AMM and the corresponding Uniswap v3
18
Besides being non-systematic, the inaccuracies introduced are likely to be minimal. To illus-
trate this, we calculate that the difference between assuming liquidity to be constant over a full
block instead of over each swap is 0.01% over 6 months for the WETH-USDC 0.05% pool. We
expect the inaccuracies from assuming the liquidity to be constant during each swap to be even
smaller.5 Empirical analysis 23

(b) Less traded pairs, with Binance prices obtained by combining the prices of the two
respective USDT pairs.
Fig. 6: Comparison over six months (April 2023 to October 2023): The difference
between the return of providing liquidity to an FM-AMM and on Uniswap v3.
Note that, relative to FM-AMM LPs, Uniswap v3 LPs lose to arbitrageurs
but gain fees from noise traders. Comparing the return of the two liquidity
positions is, therefore, equivalent to arbitrageurs’ profits minus fees collected
from noise traders on Uniswap v3.5 Empirical analysis 24
pool. For each trading pair, the FM-AMM trading fee is set equal to the fee of the
Uniswap v3 pool we are comparing to.
For most high-volume pairs, providing liquidity on an FM-AMM consistently
outperforms providing liquidity on Uniswap (see Figure 6a). The ETH-USDT 0.05%
pool is the only exception, as the FM-AMM and Uniswap v3 returns are approxi-
mately equal. Remember that the comparison between FM-AMM and Uniswap v3
illustrates whether trading fees exceed or fall short of arbitrage profits on Uniswap
V3. With this respect, our results indicate that providing liquidity to the largest
and most traded Uniswap v3 pools is unprofitable: trading fees in these pools do
not sufficiently compensate liquidity providers for arbitrage losses. On the other
hand, for pools containing less-traded tokens, the results are mixed, with Uniswap
v3 outperforming FM-AMM on some token pairs (see Figure 6b). However, the ab-
solute difference between cumulative returns is generally quite small. For all pools,
the FM-AMM receiving 30% of Uniswap v3’s total trading volume as noise trading
volume would suffice for the FM-AMM to outperform. This scenario seems realistic,
as the share of noise trading on Uniswap is likely higher than 30%19
.
FM-AMM fees So far, we assumed that the simulated FM-AMM has the same fee
as the corresponding Uniswap pool. We now explore whether choosing a different
fee would have generated higher returns for FM-AMM LPs.
Remember that the fee affects the size of the rebalancing trade, with higher fees
implying smaller rebalancing trades (cf equation 3), which always occur at the new
equilibrium price. The fee also determines whether arbitrageurs rebalance the pool,
with higher fees implying a lower probability that the pool will be rebalanced. In
turn, the probability of rebalancing impacts the return of providing liquidity to FM-
AMM because of path dependence. For example, an FM-AMM earns more when it
settles one large batch instead of two smaller batches trading in the same direction.
In this case, rebalancing less frequently may be beneficial. However, settling a
single large batch in which opposite trades net out may generate little or no trade
(and hence little or no benefit to the FM-AMM), while settling two smaller batches
trading in opposite directions moves the FM-AMM “up the curve” each time. In
this case, rebalancing more frequently may be more beneficial.
Figure 7 shows two examples, one in which a fee of zero is optimal and another in
which a strictly positive fee is optimal (see Appendix B for additional token pairs).
In most cases, the optimal fee is zero, which implies more frequent rebalancing.
There are exceptions, though, where LP returns on an FM-AMM would have been
highest for a larger-than-zero fee.
Of course, these results do not necessarily extend to an FM-AMM with a positive

This is based on Heimbach et al. (2024) finding that 30% of Uniswap volume can be attributed
to non-atomic arbitrage, while less than 3% each are sandwich attack and atomic arbitrage volume
according to labeling by https://zeromev.org/.5 Empirical analysis 25

volume of noise trading. They, however, illustrate that in the previous comparison
with Uniswap v3, it is restrictive to use for FM-AMM the same fee as for Uniswap
v3. For example, the MATIC-ETH FM-AMM with no noise traders and the same
fee as Uniswap v3 underperforms Uniswap v3 by 0.65%, which is reduced to 0.39%
if the FM-AMM has zero fee.
## 5.3 Extension: FM-AMM with noise trading
One important limitation of our data is that we do not know which Uniswap trans-
actions are noise trading, arbitrageurs rebalancing the pool, or sandwich attacks.
However, Heimbach et al. (2024) identifies 30% of the total volume on Unswap v3
as non-atomic arbitrage. Also, according to labeling by https://zeromev.org/,
sandwich attack and atomic arbitrage volume correspond to 6% of Unswap v3 vol-
ume. If we extrapolate from Unsiwap v3 in general to our study pools, then in each
of our study pools, approximately 60% of trading volume is noise trading.
With this approximation in mind, we can repeat our empirical analysis under
different assumptions regarding FM-AMM noise trading volume relative to the cor-
responding Uniswap v3 pool’s noise trading volume. We report the results in Table
1. In all our study pools, the return of providing liquidity on an FM-AMM exceeds
that of providing liquidity on Uniswap as long as FM-AMM’s noise trading volume
exceeds 30% of the volume of the corresponding Uniswap pool, which under our6 Discussion: attack model. 26

## 6 Discussion: attack model.
In our model, we assumed that batching is an off-chain component of the AMM.
Although other implementations are possible (see Section 3.3), it is worth discussing
a vulnerability introduced by this assumption: the malicious “batch operator”.
Because the batching process is done off-chain, an entity must collect trades,
settle them peer-to-peer whenever possible, and settle the rest on the FM-AMM as
a single transaction. We call this entity the “batch operator”. The smart contract
managing the FM-AMM can guarantee that the batch operator cannot perform
multiple transactions per block on the FM-AMM (hence preventing manipulation
by splitting trades as described in Section 3.2). However, the batch operator has full
discretion over what transactions are included in the batch and could exploit the
FM-AMM by suppressing trades and acting as the “unique arbitrageur.” Similarly
to the first arbitrageur reaching a CFAMM after a change in the equilibrium price,
the batch operator is the only entity that can rebalance the pool and will exploit
this opportunity to maximize profits.
More precisely, suppose the external price is p∗
and that the liquidity reserves on
the FM-AMM are X and Y (in ETH and DAI, respectively). The malicious batch7 Conclusion 27

Compare this to the profits earned by an arbitrageur rebalancing a CPAMM also

Note that arbitrageurs’ and batch operators’ profits are at the expense of their
respective LPs. The above derivations, therefore, show that the loss that FM-
AMM’s LPs may face from a malicious batch operator are half of the losses that
CPAMM’s LPs routinely face from arbitrageurs.
To conclude, note that the batch operator’s behavior is observable ex-post on-
chain. It is, therefore, possible to introduce punishments on the batch operator in
case it misbehaves. There could be social punishments such as LPs withdrawing their
liquidity (and hence making FM-AMM useless), automated slashing of dedicated
funds, or even legal remedies if the batch operator is a legal entity.
## 7 Conclusion
This paper studies the design of AMM when trades are batched before reaching the
AMM. The key observation is that, because of batching, the AMM does not need to
satisfy path independence, which implies that the design space is larger than without
batching. In particular, it is possible to design a function maximizing AMM (FM-
AMM), which, for given prices, always trades to be on the highest possible value of
a given function. At the same time, batching creates competition between informed
arbitrageurs. As a result of this competition, the price at which the FM-AMM
trades is always equal to the equilibrium price (assumed determined on some very
liquid location and exogenous to the FM-AMM). Hence, whereas in a traditional
CFAMM, arbitrageurs earn profits at the expense of liquidity providers, in an FM-
AMM these profits remain with its LPs. At the same time, sandwich attacks are
eliminated because all trades within the same batch occur at the same price, equal
to the exogenously determined equilibrium price. We use Binance price data for
11 token pairs over a period of six months to simulate a lower bound to the return
of providing liquidity to an FM-AMM. We find that this lower bound generally
outperforms providing the same liquidity on Uniswap v3, and that the absolute
differences between the two are small.
Our results are robust to several extensions. In particular, in the companion
paper Canidio and Fritsch (2023), we study the case in which the batch operator
can settle the trades on the batch both on the FM-AMM and also on some otherA Mathematical derivations 28
CFAMM (while the FM-AMM can only be accessed via the batch). Also in that
version of the model, competition among arbitrageurs guarantees that the FM-AMM
always trades at the equilibrium price. The only difference is that arbitrageurs may
rebalance the FM-AMM and the CFAMM by trading with the batch and then
simultaneously backrunning the batch on the CFAMM. In that case, arbitrageurs
earn strictly positive profits at the expense of the CFAMM liquidity providers.
As discussed in the introduction, by eliminating sandwich attacks and arbitrage
profits, an FM-AMM also eliminates the vast majority of MEV. If it were widely
adopted, the only remaining MEV source of measurable size would be liquidation in
the context of lending protocols. In blockchain-based lending protocols, users borrow
a given token by pledging a different token as collateral. The collateral is liquidated
when its value drops below a threshold: the protocol sells it to whoever pays the
liquidation price—usually well below its market value—and returns the borrowed
amount. This naturally creates competition between liquidation bots and, therefore,
MEV. We conjecture that if the liquidation process were forced through the FM-
AMM batch, the liquidation would occur at the fair equilibrium price, eliminating
this remaining source of MEV. Fully exploring this possibility is left for future work.
A Mathematical derivations
Proof of Proposition 2. Suppose nose traders collectively submit trade a(i) > 0 (the
case a(i) < 0 is analogous). If arbitrageurs also submit a trade r(i) > 0, then by (5)
the effective price they pay is Y
(1−τ)(X−2(a(i)+r(i)))
. If instead they submit r(i) < 0 with
a(i)+r(i) ≤ 0, then the effective price they pay is Y (1−τ)
X−2(1−τ)(a(i)+r(i))
. If instead they
submit r(i) < 0 with a(i)+r(i) ≥ 0, then the effective price they pay is Y (1−τ)
X−2(a(i)+r(i))
.
The price faced by arbitrageurs as a function of their trade is therefore discontinuous
at r(i) = 0, where arbitrageurs shift from paying the buy price Y
(1−τ)(X−2a(i))
to
paying the sell price Y (1−τ)
X−2a(i)
. For r(i) ̸= 0, instead, the effective price paid by the
arbitrageurs is continuous, strictly increasing, goes to zero for r(i) → −∞ and to
infinity for r(i) → X − a(i).
Hence, if p∗
(µ ·i−γ) > Y
(1−τ)(X−2a(i))
or p∗
(µ ·i−γ) < Y (1−τ)
X−2a(i)
, then there exists
a unique r∗
(i) such that
p̃(a(i) + r∗
(i),r∗
(i),τ) = p∗
(µ · i − γ),
In this case, r∗
(i) is an equilibrium because no arbitrageur can be better off by
trading more or less with the batch. The fact that such an equilibrium is unique can
be established by contradiction: suppose the equilibrium is r′
with p̃(a(i)+r′

p∗
(k · i − γ). Then by the fact that p̃(a(i) + r′

an arbitrageur could submit an additional trade k such that p̃(a(i) + r′

(k ·i−γ) and earn strictly positive profits, which implies that r′
is not an
equilibrium.
Finally, it is easy to check that if p∗
(k · i − γ) ∈ [ Y
(1−τ)(X−2a(i))
, (1−τ)Y
X−2a(i)
], then
arbitrageurs have no profitable trade opportunity: if arbitrageurs also buy ETH
they pay at least (1−τ)Y
X−2a(i)
, which is greater than the equilibrium price; if arbitrageurs
sell ETH they receive at most Y
(1−τ)(X−2a(i))
per ETH sold, which is less than the
equilibrium price.
Proof of Proposition 3. Note that the volume of noise trading is independent of
the price. Hence, for given prices, a FM-AMM maximizes V (p,τ) = maxx U(x +
a(i),p,τ) with demand function (net of noise trading) given by x(p,τ) ≡ argmaxxU(x+
a(i),p,τ) ̸= 0.
The first observation is that the value function V (p,τ) = maxx U(x + a(i),p,τ)
is convex in p, strictly so if there is strictly positive trade (i.e., if x(p,τ) ̸= 0). To
see this, use the envelope theorem to write:
∂V (p,τ)
∂p
=

 
 
(X − x(p,τ) − a(i))x(p,τ) if x(p,τ) > 0

x(p,τ) if x(p,τ) < 0

so that

∂x(p,τ)

∂x(p,τ)
∂p
X
1−τ
− a(i) − 2x(p,τ)

if x(p,τ) < 0
0 if x(p,τ) = 0
Because p and x are strict complements in the objective function, by Topkis’s the-
orem, ∂x(p,τ)
∂p
> 0 whenever x(p,τ) ̸= 0. Also, the FM-AMM always trades so that
(X − a(i) − 2x(p,τ)) > 0 and X
1−τ
− a(i) − 2x(p,τ)

> 0. It follows that V (p,τ) is
strictly convex in p whenever x(p,τ) ̸= 0.
Next, note that if there is a rebalancing event, then p = p∗
(µ · i − γ). If there
is no rebalancing event, then V (p,τ) is independent of the price. Because F() is a
mean-preserving spread of G(), then
EF [V (p,τ)] ≥ EG[V (p,τ)]
with strict inequality as long as x(p,τ) > 0 (i.e., there is a rebalancing event) for
some realization of p∗
(µ · i − γ).
