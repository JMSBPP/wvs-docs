Abstract
This chapter explains the logic of structural econometric models and compares them
to other types of econometric models. We provide a framework researchers can use
to develop and evaluate structural econometric models. This framework pays particu-
lar attention to describing different sources of unobservables in structural models. We
use our framework to evaluate several literatures in industrial organization economics,
including the literatures dealing with market power, product differentiation, auctions,
regulation and entry.

1. Introduction
The founding members of the Cowles Commission defined econometrics as: “a branch
of economics in which economic theory and statistical method are fused in the analysis
of numerical and institutional data” [Hood and Koopmans (1953, p. xv)]. Today econo-
mists refer to models that combine explicit economic theories with statistical models as
structural econometric models.
This chapter has three main goals. The first is to explain the logic of structural econo-
metric modeling. While structural econometric models have the logical advantage of
detailing the economic and statistical assumptions required to estimate economic quan-
tities, the fact that they impose structure does not automatically make them sensible. To
be convincing, structural models minimally must be: (1) flexible statistical descriptions
of data; (2) respectful of the economic institutions under consideration; and, (3) sen-
sitive to the nonexperimental nature of economic data. When, for example, there is
little economic theory on which to build, the empiricist may instead prefer to use non-
structural or descriptive econometric models. Alternatively, if there is a large body of
relevant economic theory, then there may significant benefits to estimating a structural
econometric model – provided the model can satisfy the above demands.
A second goal of this chapter is to describe the ingredients of structural models and
how structural modelers go about evaluating them. Our discussion emphasizes that the
process of building a structural model involves a series of related steps. These steps are
by no means formulaic and often involve economic, statistical and practical compro-
mises. Understanding when and why structural modelers must make compromises, and
that structural modelers can disagree on compromises, is important for understanding
that structural modeling is in part “art”. For example, structural modelers often intro-
duce “conditioning variables” that are not explicitly part of the economic theory as a
way of controlling for plausible differences across observations.
Our third goal is to illustrate how structural modeling tradeoffs are made in practice.
Specifically, we examine different types of structural econometric models developed by
industrial organization (“IO”) economists. These models examine such issues as: the
extent of market power possessed by firms; the efficiency of alternative market alloca-
tion mechanisms (e.g., different rules for running single and multi-unit auctions); and
the empirical implications of information and game-theoretic models. We should em-
phasize that this chapter is NOT a comprehensive survey of the IO literature or even
a complete discussion of any single topic. Readers interested in a comprehensive re-
view of a particular literature should instead begin with the surveys we cite. Our goal is
instead to illustrate selectively how IO researchers have used economic and statistical
assumptionstoidentifyandestimateeconomicmagnitudes.Ourhopeisthatindoingso,
we can provide a better sense of the benefits and limitations of structural econometric
models.
We begin by defining structural econometric models and discussing when one would
want to use a structural model. As part of this discussion, we provide a framework4282 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
for evaluating the benefits and limitations of structural models. The remainder of the
chapter illustrates some of the practical tradeoffs IO researchers have made.
2. Structural models defined
In structural econometric models, economic theory is used to develop mathematical
statements about how a set of observable “endogenous” variables, y, are related to an-
other set of observable “explanatory” variables, x. Economic theory also may relate the
y variables to a set of unobservable variables, ξ. These theoretical relations usually are
in the form of equalities: y = g(x,ξ,Θ), where g(·) is a known function and Θ a set
of unknown parameters or functions. Occasionally, economic theory may only deliver
inequality relations, such as y ⩾ g(x,ξ,Θ).
Economic theory alone usually does not provide enough information for the
econometrician to estimate Θ. For this reason, and because the economic model
y = g(x,ξ,Θ) may not be able to rationalize the observed data perfectly, the econo-
metrician adds statistical assumptions about the joint distribution of x,ξ and other
unobservables appended to the model. Taken together, these economic and statisti-
cal assumptions define an empirical model that is capable of rationalizing all possible
observable outcomes. In order to estimate the underlying primitives of this model, re-
searchers use statistical objects based on the model, such as a log-likelihood function
for the data, (y,x | Θ), or conditional moments, such as E(y | x,Θ).
Nonstructural empirical work in economics may or may not be based on formal
statistical models. At one end of the spectrum are measurement studies that focus on
constructingand summarizingdata, such as labor force participationandunemployment
rates. At the other end are those that use formal statistical models, such as autoregres-
sive conditional volatility models. Both types of nonstructural empirical work have a
long and respected tradition in economics. An excellent early example is Engel’s (1857)
workrelatingcommoditybudgetsharestototalincome.Engel’sfindingthatexpenditure
shares for food were negatively related to the logarithm of total household expendi-
tures has shaped subsequent theoretical and empirical work on household consumption
behavior [see Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) and Pollak and Wales (1992)]. A some-
what more recent example of descriptive work is the Phillips curve. Phillips (1958)
documented an inverse relationship between United Kingdom unemployment rates and
changes in wage rates. This work inspired others to document relationships between
unemployment rates and changes in prices. In the ensuing years, many economic theo-
ries have been advanced to explain why Phillips curves are or are not stable economic
relations.
Nonstructural empirical models usually are grounded in economics to the extent that
economics helps identify which variables belong in y and which in x. This approach,
however, ultimately estimates characteristics of the joint population density of x and y,
f(x,y), or objects that can be derived from it, such as:Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4283
f(y | x), the conditional density of y given x;
E(y | x), the conditional expectation of y given x;
Cov(y | x), the conditional covariances (or correlations) of y given x; or,
Qα(y | x) the α conditional quantile of y given x.
The most commonly estimated characteristic of the joint density is the best linear pre-
dictor (BLP(y | x)) of y given x.
More recently researchers have taken advantage of developments in nonparamet-
ric and semiparametric statistical methods to derive consistent estimates of the joint
density of y and x. For example, statisticians have proposed kernel density techniques
and other data smoothing methods for estimating f(x,y). These same smoothing tech-
niques have been used to develop nonparametric conditional mean models. Silverman
(1986), Härdle (1990), Härdle and Linton (1994) and others provide useful introduc-
tions to these procedures. A major advantage of nonparametric models is that they can
provide flexible descriptions of the above statistical quantities.
Given their flexibility, it would seem that nonstructural empirical researchers should
always prefer nonparametric methods. There are, however, limitations to nonparametric
methods. One is that they may require large amounts of data to yield much precision.1
Second, and more important, once estimated, it is unclear how a flexible estimate of a
joint density can be used to recover economic constructs such as economies of scale in
production and consumer welfare. Moreover, it is also unclear how to perform out-of-
sample counterfactual calculations, such as the impact of an additional bidder on the
winning bid in an auction.
It is tempting to look at our descriptions of structural versus nonstructural models,
and parametric versus nonparametric models, and see them as absolutes – empirical
models are either structural or nonstructural, parametric or nonparametric. We see little
value in such absolute classification exercises. In practice, it is not uncommon to find
structural econometric models that include nonstructural components or nonparamet-
ric components. Our goal in providing these definitions is to have an initial basis for
classifying and evaluating the success of an econometric model.
An initial example from IO may help understand our focus and intent. Consider a
researcher who observes the winning bids, y = {y1,...,yT }, in each of a large num-
ber of T similar auctions. Suppose the researcher also observes the number of bidders,
x = {x1,...,xT }, in each auction. To understand the equilibrium relationship between
winning bids and the number of bidders the researcher could use a structural or a non-
structural approach.
## 1 Silverman (1986) argues that researchers using these techniques face a “curse of dimensionality”, wherein
the amount of data required to obtain precise estimates grows rapidly with the dimensions of x and y. His
calculations (1986, Table 4.2) suggest that researchers may need thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of
observations before they can place great faith in these flexible techniques. For instance, more than ten times
as much data is required to attain the same level of precision for a four-dimensional as a two-dimensional
joint density. More than 200 times as much data is required for an eight-dimensional as a four-dimensional
density.4284 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
A standard nonstructural approach would be to regress winning bids on the number
of bidders. Under standard statistical assumptions, this regression would deliver the best
linearpredictorofwinningbidsgiventhenumberofbidders.Thesecoefficientestimates
could be used to predict future winning bids as a function of the number of bidders. Al-
ternatively, a researcher worried about a nonlinear relationship between winning bids
and the number of bidders might instead opt to use nonparametric smoothing tech-
niques to estimate the conditional density of winning bids given each distinct observed
number of bidders x, f(y | x). The researcher could then use this estimated conditional
density,  f(y | x), to calculate whether, for example, expected winning bids in the sam-
ple auctions increased or decreased with the number of bidders. The researcher could
also check to see if the conditional expected bid increased or decreased linearly with
the number of bidders.
The process of formulating and implementing either of these nonstructural models
so far has made little use of economics, except perhaps to identify what is y and what
is x. For instance, our discussion of these descriptive models has made no reference
to institutional features of the auctions (e.g., sealed-bid versus open-outcry and first-
price versus second-price). It also has not required economic assumptions about bidder
behavior or characteristics (e.g., risk-neutrality, expected profit maximization and bid-
der competition). In some cases (e.g., sealed-bid versus open-outcry), we may be able
to incorporate these considerations into a nonstructural model by introducing them as
conditioning variables. In other cases (e.g., the degree of risk aversion), this may not be
possible.
A key reason then to use economic theory, beyond specifying x and y, is to clarify
how institutional and economic conditions affect relationships between y and x. This
specificity is essential once the researcher wishes to make causal statements about esti-
mated relationships or use them to perform counterfactuals. Suppose for example, the
researcher has regressed winning bids on the number of bidders and estimates the coef-
ficient on the number of bidders is $100. Can this estimate be interpreted as the causal
effect of adding another bidder to a future auction? We would argue that without further
knowledge about the institutional and economic features of the auctions under study the
answer is no. What separates structural models from nonstructural models, and some
structural models from others, is how clearly the connections are made between institu-
tional, economic, and statistical assumptions and the estimated relationships. While it is
possible to assert that assumptions exist that make the estimated relationship causal, the
plausibility of such claims ultimately rests on whether these assumptions are reasonable
for the researcher’s application.
As we discuss later in Section 8, IO economists have developed a variety of structural
models of auction bid data. These models have been used to derive causal models of the
equilibrium relations between winning bids and the number of bidders. Paarsch (1992),
for example, was the first to compare empirical models of winning bids in private value
and common value sealed-bid auctions. For instance, he showed that for sealed-bid
auctions with risk-neutral, expected profit-maximizing, Pareto-distributed-private-value
bidders would have the following density of winning bids y given a known number ofCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4285
bidders, x:
f(y | x,θ) =
θ2x
yθ2x+1

θ1θ2(x − 1)
θ2(x − 1) − 1
θ2x
.
Using this density, Paarsch derives the expected value of the winning bid conditional on
the number of bidders:
E(y | x) =

θ1θ2(x − 1)
θ2(x − 1) − 1

θ2x
θ2x − 1
.
Paarsch’s paper motivated IO economists to think about what types of institutional,
economic and statistical assumptions were necessary to recover causal relationships
from auction data. For example, researchers have asked how risk aversion, collusion
and asymmetric information change the equilibrium distribution of bids. Researchers
also have compared the observable implications of using sealed-bid versus open-outcry
auctions.
In closing this section, we should re-emphasize the general goal of structural econo-
metric modeling. Structural econometric models use economic and statistical assump-
tions to identify economic quantities from the joint density of economic data, f(x,y).
The main strength of this approach is that, done right, it can make clear what economic
assumptions are required to draw causal economic inferences from the distribution of
economic data.
3. Constructing structural models
Having introduced the concept of a structural model, we now explore how structural
modelers go about constructing econometric models.
3.1. Sources of structure
There are two general sources of “structure” in structural models – economics and sta-
tistics. Economics allows the researcher to infer how economicbehavior and institutions
affect relationships between a set of economic conditions x and outcomes y. Often these
economic models are deterministic, and as such do not speak directly to the distribution
of noisy economic data. Structural econometric modelers thus must add statistical struc-
ture in order to rationalize why economic theory does not perfectly explain data. As we
show later, this second source of structure may affect which economic quantities a re-
searcher can recover and which estimation methods are preferable.
In any structural modeling effort a critical issue will be: How did the structural
modeler know what choices to make when introducing economic and statistical as-
sumptions? Most answers to this question fall into one of three categories: those made
toreflecteconomicrealities;thosemadetorationalizewhatisobservedinthedataorde-
scribe how the data were generated; and, those made to simplify estimation. We should4286 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
note at the outset that there is no necessary agreement among structural modelers as to
how to make these choices. Some purists, for example, believe that structural models
must come from fully-specified stochastic economic models. Others find it acceptable
to add structure if that structure facilitates estimation or allows the researcher to re-
cover economically meaningful parameters. For instance, economic theory may make
predictions about the conditional density of y given x, f(y | x), but may be silent about
the marginal density of x, f(x). In this case, a researcher might assume that the mar-
ginal density of x does not contain parameters that appear in the conditional density. Of
course, there is nothing to guarantee that assumptions made to facilitate estimation are
reasonable.
The “structure” in a structural model is there because the researcher explicitly or
implicitly chose to put it there. Although we have argued that one of the advantages
of a structural econometric model is that researchers can examine the sensitivity of the
structural model estimates to alternative assumptions, this is sometimes easier said than
done.
The following example illustrates how some of these issues can arise even in a famil-
iar linear regression setting. Specifically, we ask what types of assumptions are required
to interpret a regression of outputs on inputs as a production function.
EXAMPLE 1. Imagine an economist with cross-section, firm-level data on output, Qt,
labor inputs, Lt, and capital inputs, Kt. To describe the relationship between firm i’s
output and inputs, the economist might estimate the regression:
(1) lnQt = θ0 + θ1 lnLt + θ2 lnKt + t,
by ordinary least squares (OLS). In this regression, the θ’s are unknown coefficients and
the t is an error term that accounts for the fact that the right-hand side input variables
do not perfectly predict log output.
What do we learn by estimating this regression? Absent more information we have
estimated a descriptive regression. More precisely, we have estimated the parameters of
the best linear predictor of yt = ln(Qt) given xt = (1,ln(Lt),ln(Kt)) for our sample
of data. Goldberger (1991, Chapter 5) provides an excellent discussion of best linear
predictors. The best linear predictor of y given a univariate x is BLP(y | x) = a + bx,
where a = E(y) − bE(x) and b = Cov(y,x)/Var(x). Absent more structure, the
coefficients a and b are simply functions of population moments of f(x,y).
If we add to our descriptive model the assumption that the sample second moments
converge to their population counterparts

t = Mxx and lim

xtyt = Mxy,
and that Mxx is a matrix of full rank, then OLS will deliver consistent estimates of the
parameters of the best linear predictor function. Thus, if we are interested in predicting
the logarithm of output, we do not need to impose any economic structure and very littleCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4287
statistical structure to estimate consistently the linear function of the logarithm of labor
and logarithm of capital that best predicts (in a minimum-mean-squared-error sense) the
logarithm of output.
Many economists, however, see regression (1) as more than a descriptive regression.
They base their reasoning on the observation that (1) essentially looks like a logarithmic
restatement of a Cobb–Douglas production function: Qt = ALα
t K
β
t exp(t). Because
of the close resemblance, they might interpret (1) as a production function.
A critical missing step in this logic is that a Cobb–Douglas production function typ-
ically is a deterministic relationship for the producer, whereas the regression model (1)
includes an error term. Where did the error term in the empirical model come from? The
answer to this question is critical because it affects whether OLS will deliver consistent
estimates of the parameters of the Cobb–Douglas production function, as opposed to
consistent estimates of the parameters of the best linear predictor of the logarithm of
output given the logarithms of the two inputs. In other words, it is the combination of
an economic assumption (production is truly Cobb–Douglas) and statistical assump-
tions (t satisfies certain moment conditions) that distinguishes a structural model from
a descriptive one.
Deterministic production function models provide no guidance about the properties
of the disturbance in (1). The researcher thus is left to sort out what properties are appro-
priate from the details of the application. One could imagine, for instance, the modeler
declaring that the error is an independently-distributed, mean-zero measurement error
in output, and that these errors are distributed independently of the firms’ input choices.
In this case, OLS has the potential to deliver consistent estimates of the production
function parameters.
But how did the modeler know that t was all measurement error? As we discuss
later this is likely too strong an assumption. A more plausible assumption is that the
error also includes an unobservable (to the econometrician) difference in each firm’s
productivity (e.g., an unobservable component of At in the Cobb–Douglas function).
The existence of such components raises the possibility that the input choices are corre-
lated with t. Such correlations invalidate the use of OLS to recover consistent estimates
of the parameters of the Cobb–Douglas production function.
Even if one were willing to assume that t is measurement error distributed indepen-
dently of xt, additional economic structure is necessary to interpret the OLS parameter
estimates as coefficients of a Cobb–Douglas production function. By definition, a pro-
duction function gives the maximum technologically feasible amount of output that can
be produced from a vector of inputs. Consequently, under this stochastic structure, un-
less the researcher is also willing to assert that the firms in the sample are producing
along their Cobb–Douglas production function, OLS applied to (1) does not yield con-
sistent estimates of the parameters of this production function. In a theoreticalrealm, the
assumption of technologically efficient production is relatively innocuous. However, it
may not fit the institutional realities of many markets. For example, a state-owned firm
may use labor in a technologically inefficient manner to maximize its political capital
with unions. Regulators also may force firms to operate off their production functions.4288 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Both of these examples underscore the point that care must exercised to ensure that the
economic model fits the institutional reality of what is being studied.
This example demonstrates what assumptions are necessary for a linear regression
model to have a causal economic interpretation as a production function. First, the
researcher must specify an economic model of the phenomenon under consideration,
including in this case the functional form for the production function. Second, she must
incorporate unobservables into the economic model. This second step should receive
significantly more attention than it typically does. This is because the assumptions made
about the unobservables will impact the consistency of OLS parameter estimates. Sec-
tions 4 and 5 further illustrate the importance of stochastic specifications and potential
pitfalls.
3.2. Why add structure?
We see three general reasons for specifying and estimating a structural econometric
model.
First, a structural model can be used to estimate unobserved economic or behavioral
parameters that could not otherwise be inferred from nonexperimental data. Examples
of structural parameters include: marginal cost; returns to scale; the price elasticity of
demand; and the impact of a change in an exogenous variable on the amount demanded
or on the amount supplied.
Second, structural models can be used to perform counterfactuals or policy simula-
tions. In counterfactuals, the researcher uses the estimated structural model to predict
what would happen if elements of the economic environment change. For example,
suppose that we have estimated the demand for a product and the monopolist’s cost
function. We could then, with added assumptions, use these estimates to calculate
how market prices and quantities would change if an identical second firm entered the
monopoly market.
For these calculations to be convincing, the structural modeler must be able to ar-
gue that the structural model will be invariant to the contemplated change in economic
environment. Thus, if we were to evaluate instead the effect of a regulator capping a mo-
nopolist’s price, we would have to maintain that the monopolist’s cost function would
not change as a result of the regulation. That these assumptions need to be made and
checked is again another illustration of the value of a structural model – it can help re-
searchers identify what assumptions are required in order to draw inferences and make
predictions about economic behavior and phenomena.
Finally, structural models can be used to compare the predictive performance of two
competingtheories.Forexample,wecouldcomparetheperformanceofquantity-setting
versus price-setting models of competition. It is important to emphasize that these com-
parisons do not provide unambiguous tests of the underlying economic theories. Indeed,
these comparisons are always predicated on untestable assumptions that are not part
of the theory. For instance, any “test” of quantity-setting behavior versus price-settingCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4289
behavior is predicated on the maintained functional forms for demand, costs, and the
unobservables. Thus, the only sense in which one can “test” the two theories is to ask
whether one of these ways of combining the same economic and stochastic primitives
provides a markedly better description of observed or out-of-sample data.
Because we cannot test economic models independent of functional form assump-
tions for a finite number of observations, it is important to recognize that structural
parameter estimates may well be sensitive to these assumptions. For example, if we
were trying to estimate consumer surplus, we should be aware that it might make a
tremendous difference that we assumed demand was linear, as opposed to constant
elasticity. While this sensitivity to functional form can be viewed as a weakness, it
also can be viewed as a strength. This is again because the “structure” in structural
models forces researchers to grapple directly with the economic consequences of as-
sumptions.
The “structure” in structural models also can affect statistical inferences about eco-
nomic primitives. Here we have in mind the impact that a researcher’s functional form
choices can have on the size and power of hypothesis tests. When, as is usually the
case, economic theory does not suggest functional forms or what other variables might
be relevant in an application, researchers will be forced to make what may seem to be
arbitrary choices. These choices can have a critical impact on inferences about parame-
ters. For example,if a researcher wants to fail to reject a null hypothesis, then she should
specify an extremely rich functional form with plenty of variables that are not part of
the economic theory. Such a strategy will likely decrease the power of the statistical test.
For instance, if a researcher would like to fail to reject the integrability conditions for
her demand functions, she should include as many demographic variables as possible
in order to soak up across-household variation in consumption. This will tend to reduce
the apparent precision of the estimated price coefficients and make it difficult to reject
the null hypothesis of integrability. Conversely, if she would like to reject integrability,
then she should include few, if any, demographic controls. This would increase the ap-
parent precision in the price coefficients and increase the likelihood of rejection for two
reasons: (1) she has reduced the number of irrelevant variables; and, (2) the effect of
price may be exaggerated by the omission of relevant variables that are correlated with
prices.
This discussion underscores the delicate position empiricists are in when they attempt
to “test” a particular parameter or theory. For this reason, structural modelers should
experiment with and report how sensitive their inferences are to plausible changes in
functionalforms,ortheinclusionandexclusionofvariablesnotcloselytiedtoeconomic
theory.
Finally, we should emphasize that these putative advantages do not always mean
structural models should be favored over nonstructural models. Indeed, there are many
interesting applications where there is little or no useful economic theory to guide em-
pirical work. We certainly do not believe this should stop the collection or description
of data. When on the other hand there is a substantial body of economic theory to guide
empirical work, researchers should take advantage of it. In some cases, there may be a4290 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
large body of economic theory on a particular topic, but that theory may have few im-
plications for data. In this case, structural modelers can make important contributions
by making it clear what is needed to link theory to data. By being clear about what in
the theory the empirical researcher can estimate, it becomes easier for economists to
improve existing theory.
The advantages of structural models of course do not all come for free. All economic
theories contain assumptions that are not easily relaxed. While theorists sometimes
have the luxury of being able to explore stylized models with simplifying assumptions,
structural econometric modelers have to worry that when they use stylized or simpli-
fying assumptions they will be dismissed as arbitrary, or worse: insensitive to the way
the world “really works”. This problem is compounded by the fact that economic data
rarelycomefromcontrolledexperimentalsettings.Thismeansthatstructuraleconomet-
ric modelers often must recognize nonstandard ways in which nonexperimental data are
generated and collected (e.g., aggregation and censoring). Such complications likely
will force the structural modeler to simplify. The danger in all of these cases is that
the structural model can then be seen as “too naive” to inform a sophisticated body of
theory. We expect that readers can see this already in Example 1.
3.3. Evaluating structure – single equation models
The standard multiple linear regression model is a useful place to begin understand-
ing issues that arise in evaluating and interpreting structural and nonstructural models.
Consider the linear regression model, y = α + xβ + . The mathematical structure of
this model lends an aura of “structure” as to how y is related to x. What motivates this
structure? A satisfactory answer to this question minimally must address why we are re-
gressing y on x. From a statistical perspective, we can always regress y on x or x on y.
The coefficients in these regressions can then be given statistical interpretations as the
coefficients of best linear predictor functions. Issues of economic causality, however,
are not resolved simply because a researcher puts y on the left-hand side and x on the
right-hand side of a linear equation.
Economists estimating linear regression models usually invoke economic arguments
to make a case that x causes y. Assuming that the researcher has made a convincing
case, what should be made of the regression of y on x? Absent an economic model
showing that y and x are linearly related, all one can say is that under certain conditions
ordinary least squares regression will provide consistent estimates of a best linear pre-
dictor function. The regression does not necessarily deliver an estimate of how much
the conditional mean of y changes with a one unit change in x, and certainly not the
causal impact of a one-unit change in x on y.
Despite this, some researchers use regression coefficient signs to corroborate an eco-
nomic model in the belief that multiple regressions “hold constant” other variables.
For example, a researcher might develop a deterministic economic model that shows:
“when x increases, y increases”. This result then becomes the economic justification
for using a regression of y on x and other variables to “test” the theory. One problemCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4291
with this approach is that unless the economic model delivers a linear conditional mean
specification for y given x, the regression evidence about the sign of x need not match
deterministic comparative statics predictions. In general, the empirical researcher must
first use economics and statistics to demonstrate that the relevant economic quantity
or comparative static effect can be identified using the available data and estimation
technique. To see this point more clearly, consider the following example.
EXAMPLE 2. A microeconomist has cross-section data on a large number of compa-
rable firms. The data consist of outputs, Q, in physical units, total costs, TC, and the
firms’ two input prices, pK and pL. The researcher’s goal is to learn about the firms’
(by assumption) common technology of production. The researcher decides to do this
by estimating one of the following regression models:
Model 1: lnTCi = θ0 + θ1 lnQi + θ2 lnpKi + θ3 lnpLi + ηi,
(2) Model 2: lnQi = β0 + β1 lnTCi +β2 lnpKi + β3 lnpLi + i.
These specifications differ according to whether the natural logarithm of output or the
natural logarithm of total costs is a dependent or independent variable.
Which specification makes better economic sense? In an informal poll of colleagues,
we found most thought Model 1 was more sensible than Model 2. The logic most often
given for preferring Model 1 is that it looks like a cost function regression. When asked
how to interpret the parameters of this regression specification, most say that θ1 is an
estimate of the elasticity of total cost with respect to output. As such, it provides a
measure of scale economies. Those who prefer the second equation seem to base their
preference on an argument that total cost is more likely to be “exogenous”. To them
this means that OLS is more likely to deliver consistent estimates of production or cost
parameters.
How might we go about deciding which specification is correct? A structural modeler
answers this question by answering two prior questions: What economic and statistical
assumptions justify each model? And, do these assumptions make sense for the appli-
cation at hand? In Example 5 of Section 4, we show that Models 1 and 2 can be derived
from competing plausible economic and stochastic assumptions. That is, under one set
of economic and stochastic modeling assumptions, we can derive Model 1. Under an-
other set of assumptions, we can do the same for Model 2. Without knowing the details
of the firms and markets being studied, it is impossible to decide which set of assump-
tions is more appropriate.
How do researchers only interested in data description decide which specification
is correct? They too must answer prior questions. But these questions only pertain to
the goals of their statistical analysis. If, for example, their goal is prediction, then they
would choose between Models 1 and 2 based on the variable they are trying to pre-
dict. They then would have to decide which right-hand side variables to use and how
these variables would enter the prediction equation. Here, researchers have to worry4292 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
that if their goal is post-sample prediction, they may over-fit within sample by includ-
ing too many variables. While statistical model selection criteria can help systematize
the process of selecting variables, it is not always clear what one should make of the
resulting model.
In some cases, researchers do not have a clear economic model or descriptive cri-
terion in mind when they estimate a regression model such as Model 1 by ordinary
least squares. In this case, what can be made of the coefficient estimates obtained
from regressing y on the vector x? As discussed above, ordinary least squares deliv-
ers consistent estimates of the coefficients in the best linear predictor of y given x.
But what information does the BLP(y | x) provide about the joint distribution of y
and x? In general, the BLP will differ from the more informative conditional expecta-
tion of y given x, E(y | x), which is obtained from f(x,y) as

yf(y | x)dy. Thus,
θ1 = ∂ BLP(y | x)/∂x1 in Model 1 will not in general equal how much expected log
total costs will increase if we increase log output by one unit (i.e., ∂E(y | x)/∂x1).
Only under certain conditions on the joint density of y and x are the BLP function and
the conditional expectation function the same. Despite this well-known general lack of
equivalence between the BLP(y | x) and E(y | x), many descriptive studies treat lin-
ear regression slope coefficient estimates as if they were estimates of the derivative of
E(y | x) with respect to x. Occasionally, some studies adopt the position that while
the best linear predictor differs from the conditional expectation, the signs of the coeffi-
cients of the BLP(y | x) will be the same as those of ∂E(y | x)/∂x provided the signs
of ∂E(y | x)/∂x do not change with x. Unfortunately, as White (1980) demonstrates,
there is no reason to expect that this will be true in general.
When the conditional expectation of y is nonlinear in x, statistical theory tells us (un-
der certain sampling assumptions) that a regression provides a best (minimum expected
squared prediction error) linear approximation to the nonlinear conditional expectation
function. It is perhaps this result that some place faith in when they attempt to use re-
gressions to validate an economic comparative static result. However, absent knowledge
from economics or statistics about the joint distribution of y and x, this approximation
result may be of limited value. We do not, for example, know how good the linear ap-
proximation is. We do not know if x causes y or y causes x. In sum, BLP(y | x) and
E(y | x) are simply descriptive statistical quantities.
By making economic and statistical assumptions, however, we can potentially learn
something from the linear approximation. For example, if we had an economic theory
that suggested that there was a negative causal relationship between y and z, then the
bivariate regression slope coefficient’s sign might tell us whether the evidence is consis-
tent with the theory. But this may be a weak confirmation of the theory and it certainly
does not provide us with a sense of the strength of the relationship if the conditional
mean function, E(y | z), is nonlinear in z.
Descriptive researchers (and structural modelers) also have to worry about whether
they have collected all of the data needed to examine a particular prediction about a
conditional mean. Consider, for example, the case where an economic theory delivers
a prediction about the conditional mean of y given x1 and x2, E(y | x1,x2), whereCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4293
y, x1 and x2 are scalars. Suppose that y is a customer’s demand for electricity during
the day, x1 is the price of electricity during the day, and x2 is average temperature
during the day. Economic theory predicts that electricity demand is decreasing in the
daily price after controlling for the average daily temperature. However, if we do not
include x2 on the right-hand side when we regress y on x1, then we obtain the best linear
approximation to E(y | x1), not E(y | x1,x2). The difference may be very important.
For instance, the function g(x1) = E(y | x1) may not depend on x1, whereas the
function h(x1,x2) = E(y | x1,x2) may depend on both x1 and x2.
In the usual textbook analysis of omitted variables in a linear model, it is straight-
forward to establish when an omitted variable will cause bias and produce incon-
sistent estimates. When the conditional mean is nonlinear, and we proceed as if it
is linear, the familiar reasoning is not as straightforward. In addition to the omitted
variable, we have to worry that even if we had included the omitted variable, that
∂E(y | x1,x2)/∂x1 = ∂ BLP(y | x1,x2)/∂x1. Absent a theory that says that y is
linearly related to x1 and x2, the effect of omitting a relevant regressor is much harder
to evaluate. Specifically, suppose
yt = g(x1t,x2t) + t = g(xt) + t
and E(t | xt) = 0 so that E(y | x) = g(xt) is a nonlinear function. Running an
ordinary least squares regression of yt on zt, where zt is a vector of known functions of
x1t and x2t, yields a consistent estimate of β where β is defined as follows:
yt = ztβ +

g(xt) − ztβ

+ t = ztβ + ηt.
The parameter β is the linear combination of the zt’s that best predicts the yt’s for the
population.ByconstructionE(ztηt) = 0,butthepartialderivativeofztβ withrespectto
x1 could differ in both sign and magnitude from the partial derivative of the conditional
mean, ∂g(xt)/∂x1t depending on how well ztβ approximates g(xt).
3.4. Evaluating structure – simultaneous equation models
The original Cowles Commission econometricians paid particular attention to develop-
ing econometric models that could represent the concept of an “economic equilibrium”.
Indeed, the term “structural model” often is associated with econometric models that
have multiple simultaneous equations, each of which describes economic behavior or is
an identity. The term simultaneous emphasizes that the left-hand side variables also can
appear as right-hand side variables in other equations. The term “reduced form” was
introduced to describe an alternative representation of a simultaneous system – one in
which the dependent variables were explicitly represented only as functions of the x’s
and unobservables.
To understand what is “structural” in simultaneous equations models, it is useful to
begin with a standard linear supply and demand model.4294 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
EXAMPLE 3. In a standard linear demand and supply model, the demand curve gives
the quantity that consumers would like to purchase at a given price, conditional on other
variables that affect demand, and the supply curve gives how much firms are willing to
sell at a given price, conditional on other supply shifters. Mathematically,

where Γ and B are matrices containing the unknown parameters that characterize the
behavior of consumers and producers, qt is equilibrium quantity at time t, pt is equilib-
rium price, yt is a two-dimensional vector, t is a two-dimensional vector of unobserved
random variables, and the exogenous variables, xt, consist of a constant term, a supply
shifter x1t (e.g., an input price) and a demand shifter x2t (e.g., household income).
To find out what restrictions the system (3) imposes on the conditional distribution
of y given x, we can first solve for the endogenous variables as a function of exogenous
variables and error terms. Post-multiplying both sides of (5) by Γ −1, and rearranging,
gives the reduced form
(6) y
t = x
tΠ + v
t.
The reduced form (6) shows that equilibrium prices and quantities are linear functions
of both demand and cost shifters and both demand and cost errors.
Fromthisperspective,theindividualreducedformsforequilibriumpriceandquantity
parallel the nonstructural descriptive linear regressions discussed in the previous sub-
section. Some researchers, however, over-extend this logic to claim that any regression
of an endogenous variable on exogenous variables is a “reduced form” regression. Thus,
they would for example label a regression of price on the supply shifters x2t a “reduced
form”.
The critical issue again in any regression of a y on x is what do we make of the
estimated coefficients? Returning to the reduced form system (6), to arrive at this rep-
resentation we had to first assume that the structural equations characterizing aggregate
demand and supply were linear. If we did not know they were linear, then we would not
know that the reduced form (6) was linear. In short, the functional form of the struc-
tural model determines the functional form of the reduced form relationship between yt
and xt.
The economic assumption that supply equals demand also is critical to the interpre-
tation of Π. If, for example, price floors or ceilings prevented demand from equalingCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4295
supply, then we would not obtain a standard linear model even though the underlying
demand and supply schedules were linear [see Quandt (1988)].
Even when we are assured that the reduced form has the linear form (6), we cannot
interpret the Π and proceed to estimation without completing the specification of the
demand and supply equations. To complete the structural model, for example, the re-
searcher could specify the joint distribution of x and y, or alternatively, as is common
in the literature, the conditional distribution of y given x. Still another approach is to
sacrifice estimation efficiency by imposing less structure on the joint distribution. For
example, estimation could proceed assuming the conditional moment restrictions
(7) E(t | xt) = 0 and E t
t | xt = Σ.
From these conditional moment restrictions on t, we can deduce
(8) E(vt | xt) = 0, and E vtv
t | xt = Ω,
where
(9) Π = BΓ−1
, v
t = 
tΓ −1
, and Ω = Γ−1 
ΣΓ−1
.
From (9), we see that Π and the variance–covariance matrix of the reduced form errors,
Ω, provide information about the structural parameters in Γ . Without restrictions on the
elements of Γ, B, and Σ, however, the only restriction on the conditional distribution
of yt given xt implied by the linear simultaneous equation model is that the conditional
mean of yt is linear in xt and the conditional covariance matrix of yt is constant across
observations.
To summarize, a reduced form model exists only to the extent that the researcher has
derived it from a structural economic model. If the researcher is unwilling to assume
functional forms for the supply and demand equations, then the conditional means of
qt and pt will likely be nonlinear functions of xt, the vector of the demand and supply
shifters. In this case, although we can still perform linear regressions of qt and pt on xt,
these linear regressions are not reduced forms. Instead, these regressions will deliver
consistent estimates of the parameters of the best linear predictors of the dependent
variables given xt. How these parameter estimates are related to the price elasticity
of demand or supply or other causal effects is unknown. Additionally, as discussed
earlier, unless the researcher is willing to place restrictions on the functional forms of
the conditional means of qt and pt given xt, it will be difficult to make even qualitative
statements about the properties of E(pt | xt) or E(qt | xt).
Notice, it is economic theory that allows us to go beyond descriptive or statistical
interpretations of linear regressions. If we assume stochastic linear supply and demand
equations generate yt, and impose the market-clearing conditions qs
t = qd
t , then the
equations in (9) allow us in principle to recover estimates of economic parameters from
Π and Ω. We emphasize in principle because unless the values of B,Γ, and Σ can be
uniquely recovered from Π and Ω, the structural model (3) has limited empirical con-
tent. Although the structural parameters are not identified, the linearity of the structural4296 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
model implies that the conditional mean of yt is linear in xt and the conditional variance
is constant.
One might wonder how we know that the structural model given in Equation (3) is
generating the observed yt. The answer is by now familiar: Only because economic the-
ory tells us so! Economic theory tells us what elements of xt belong in just the supply
and just the demand equations. The same theory also resolves the problem of how to
identify Γ,B, and Σ from the reduced form parameters Π and Ω. Absent restrictions
from economic theory, there are many different simultaneous equations models that can
give rise to the same reduced form parameters Π and Ω. These models may contain
radically different restrictions on the structural coefficients and impose radically differ-
ent restrictions on the behavior of economic agents, yet no amount of data will allow
us to distinguish among them. For economic theory to be useful, it minimally must de-
liver enough restrictions on Γ,B, and Σ so that the empiricist can uniquely recover
the remaining unrestricted elements of Γ,B, and Σ from estimates of Π and Ω. Thus,
any defense of the researcher’s identification restrictions can be seen as a defense of
the researcher’s economic theory. Without a clearly argued and convincing economic
theory to justify the restrictions imposed, there is little reason to attempt a structural
econometric model.
It is well known to economic theorists that without assumptions it is impossible to
derive predictions about economic behavior. For example, consumers may have pref-
erence functions and producers access to technologies. However, unless we are willing
to assume, for example, that consumers maximize utility subject to budget constraints
and producers maximize profits subject to technological constraints, it is impossible
to derive any results about how firms and consumers might respond to changes in the
underlying economic environment. An empirical researcher faces this same limitation:
without assumptions, it is impossible to derive empirical results. From a purely descrip-
tive perspective, unless a researcher is willing to assume that the joint density of x and y
satisfies certain conditions, he cannot consistently estimate underlying descriptive mag-
nitudes, such as the BLP(y | x) or the conditional density of y given x. Further, unless
an empirical researcher is willing to make assumptions about the underlying economic
environment and the form and distribution of unobservables, he cannot estimate eco-
nomically meaningful magnitudes from the resulting econometric model. So it is only
the combination of economic and statistical assumptions that allow conclusions about
economic magnitudes to be drawn from the results of an econometric modeling exer-
cise.
Econometrics texts are fond of emphasizing the importance of exclusion restrictions
for identification – an exogenous variable excluded from the equation of interest. We
would like to emphasize that identification also requires inclusion restrictions – this
exogenous variable must also be included in at least one equation of the structural
model.
This distinction is particularly important because applied researchers are typically
unwilling or unable to specify all the equations in their simultaneous equations system.
This incompleteness in the econometric model reflects an incompleteness in the eco-Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4297
nomic model. This incompleteness can and should raise doubts about the validity of
instruments. To see why, suppose economic theory delivers the following linear simul-
taneous equations model
y1 = βy2 + x1γ + 1,
(10) y2 = x1π21 + 2,
where the ’s are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) contemporaneously
correlated errors and x1 is a variable that is uncorrelated with 1 and 2. Suppose that
a researcher is interested in estimating the structural parameters β and γ in the first
equation. As it stands, these parameters are not identified. The problem is that we are
missing an instrument for y2.
What to do? One approach is to revisit the economic theory in an effort to under-
stand where additional instruments might come from. An alternative approach that is all
too common is the recommendation: “Look for an exogenous variable that is uncorre-
lated with the ’s but at the same time correlated with the right-hand side endogenous
variable y2”. While these two approaches are not necessarily incompatible, the second
approach does not seem to involve any economics. (This should sound a warning bell!)
All one needs to find is a variable that meets a statistical criterion. In some instances,
researchers can do this by searching their data sets for variables that might reasonably
be viewed as satisfying this criterion.
The following suggests how a researcher might run into problems using the statistical
approach: “Look for an exogenous variable that is uncorrelated with the ’s but at the
same time correlated with the right-hand side endogenous variable y2”. Consider first
the extreme case where we decide to create a computer-generated instrument for y2
that satisfies this criterion. That is, imagine we construct an instrumental variable, x2,
as the sum of x1 plus a computer-generated independent identically distributed random
error. This new variable satisfies the statistical criteria to be a valid instrument: it is
uncorrelated with the structural errors and yet correlated with y2. Thus, it would appear
that we can always identify the coefficients in the first equation as long as we have at
least one exogenous variable and a good random number generator.
What is amiss here is that identification also hinges on showing that x2 belongs in
the second equation. A statistical test cannot unambiguously resolve this question (es-
pecially when x1 and x2 are highly correlated). However, both economics and common
sense tell us that x2 does not belong in the reduced form. Put another way, they tell us
that x2 does not belong in the structural or reduced form model – the population value
of π22, the coefficient associated with x2 in the reduced form, is zero! Nevertheless, in
finite samples we could conclude π22 is nonzero (and perhaps statistically so).
To understand formally why this estimation strategy fails to produce consistent esti-
mates of β and γ, consider the instrumental variables estimator for these two parame-
ters. This estimator uses the instruments (x1,x2):

Because x2t = x1t + ηt and ηt is distributed independently of 1t, 2t, and x1t, the

which is a singular matrix. This result follows from substituting x1t + ηt for x2t and
x1tπ21 + 2t for y2t and then applying the appropriate laws of large numbers to each
element of the matrix. The singularity of (11) is just another way of saying that the rank
condition for identification of the first equation of the structural model fails.
At first, this example may seem extreme. No economist would use a random number
generator to create instruments – but this is our point! The researcher is informed not
to do this by economics. In practice, a researcher will never know whether a specific
instrument is valid. For example, our students sometimes insist that more clever choices
for instruments would work. After some thought, many suggest that setting x2 = x2
1
would work. Their logic is that if x1 is independent of the errors, so must x2
1. Following
the derivations above, and assuming that limT→∞
1
T
T
t=1 x3
1t = M3, a finite, positive
constant, we again obtain a singular matrix similar to (11), implying that this x2 is also
an invalid instrument for the same reason – it does not enter into the reduced form.
The value of economic theory is that it provides a defense for why the reduced form
coefficient on a prospective instrument is not zero, i.e., the instrument is included in at
least one equation of the structural model. The statistical advice that led to computer-
generated instruments and x2
1 does not do this.2
Some might argue that our example above ignores the fact that in most economic
applications, one can find exogenous economic variables that satisfy our statistical crite-
rion. The argument then goes on to claim that because these variables are economically
related, we do not need a complete simultaneous equations model. The following ex-
ample discusses this possibility.

EXAMPLE 4. Consider a researcher who has data on the prices firms charge in different
geographic markets, pi, the number of potential demanders (population) in market i,
POPi, and whether or not the firm faces competition, COMPi. The researcher seeks to
measure the “effect” of competition on prices by regressing price on market size, as
measured by the number of potential demanders and the competition dummy. That is,
he estimates the regression
(12) pi = POPi θ1 + COMPi θ2 + i.
Without an underlying economic model, the OLS estimate of θ2 on COMPi provides
an estimate of the coefficient in the best linear predictor of how prices change with the
presence of competition.
The researcher might, however, claim that Equation (12) has a structural economic
interpretation – namely that θ2 measures by how much prices would change if we could
introduce competition. One problem with this interpretation is that it is unlikely that the
presence of competition is determined independently of price. (See Section 10.) In most
entry models, competitors’ decisions to enter a market are simultaneously determined
with prices and quantities. In such cases, if the researcher does not observe critical
demand or supply variables, then OLS will deliver inconsistent estimates of θ2.
One possible solution to this problem is to find an instrumental variable for the pres-
ence of competitors. Suppose that the researcher claims that the average income of
residents in the market, Yi, is such an instrument. This claim might be justified by
statements to the effect that the instrument is clearly correlated with the presence of
competitors, as an increase in average income, holding population fixed, will increase
demand. The researcher also might assert that average income is determined inde-
pendently of demand for the good and thus will be uncorrelated with the error i in
Equation (12).
Does this make average income a valid instrument? Our answer is that the researcher
has yet to make a case. All the researcher has done is provide a statistical rationale
for the use of Yi as an instrument exactly analogous to the argument used to justify
the computer-generated instrument in Example 3. To be completely convincing, the
researcher must do two more things. First, the researcher has to explain why it makes
sense to exclude average income from Equation (12). To do this, the researcher will have
to provide a more complete economic justification for Equation (12). What type of equi-
librium relationship does Equation (12) represent? Why is the demand variable POPi in
this equation, but not average income, which also might be considered a demand vari-
able? Second, the researcher also will have to make a case that Yi enters the reduced
form for COMPi with a nonzero coefficient, or else the rank condition for identification
will fail by the logic presented in Example 3. This means to be a valid instrument it
must enter some other equation of the structural model. The researcher will have to be
clearer about the form of the complete system of equations determining prices and the
presence of competitors. This will also require the researcher to spell out the economic
model underlying the simultaneous system of equations.4300 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
This next example reiterates our point that the results of a structural modeling exer-
cise are only as credible as the economic theory underlying it. One can always impose
inclusion and exclusion restrictions, but the resulting simultaneous equations model
need not have a clear interpretation.
EXAMPLE 5. The 1960s’ and 1970s’ IO literature contains many studies that regressed
firm or industry profit rates (“performance”) on market concentration measures (“mar-
ket structure”). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many IO economists observed that
while concentration could increase profits, there could be the reverse causation: high
(low) profits would induce entry (exit). This led some to estimate linear simultaneous
equations models of the form:
PROFIT = β0 + β1CONC + x1β2 + 1,
(13) CONC = α0 + α1PROFIT + x2α2 + 2,
wherePROFIT measuresindustryprofitability,CONC measuresindustryconcentration,
the ’s are errors and the α’s and β’s are parameters to be estimated. Particular attention
was paid to estimating the effect of simultaneity bias on the signs and magnitudes of α1
and β1.
Debates about the merits of these models often centered on what variables should be
included or excluded from each equation. What proved unsatisfactory about these de-
bates was that there were no clear answers. Put another way, although these were called
“structural” models of performance and market concentration, there was no one theo-
retical model that provided a specific economic interpretation of α1 and β1. Thus, even
though instrumental variable methods might deliver consistent estimates of α1 and β1,
it was never very clear what these estimates told us about the underlying theories.
Tounderstandwhywewouldnotcallthisastructuralmodel(eventhoughitlookslike
a “structural” model in the sense of having multiple endogenous variables in a single
equation), consider these questions: How do we know the first equation is a behavioral
relation describing how industry profitability responds to industry concentration? And:
How do we know the second equation describes the way firm profitability responds to
industry concentration? The population values of β1 and α1, the parameters that charac-
terize how PROFIT responds to CONC and how CONC responds to PROFIT, depend
crucially on which elements of xt are included and excluded from each equation of
the structural model. Unless we have an economic theory telling us which elements of
xt do and do not belong in each behavioral relation, which equation we designate as
the “profit equation” and which equation we designate as a “concentration equation”
is completely arbitrary. For example, we can re-write the “profit equation” in (13) as a
“concentration equation”,
CONC = −

What is the difference between this “concentration equation” and the one in (13)? Be-
cause they obviously have the same left-hand side variable, the answer is that they differ
in what is included on the right-hand side. One has x1 and the other has x2. Only
economic theory can tell us which “concentration equation” is correct. That is, only
economic theory can tell us what agent’s behavior, or group of agents’ behaviors, is
characterized by a structural equation. For example, we might try to justify the profit
equation in (13) as representing the profit-maximizing behavior of all firms in the indus-
try for each level of industry concentration and conditioning variables. It is this same
theory that tells us the conditioning variables in the profit equation are the x1’s and not
the x2’s. Thus, economic theory also delivers the inclusion and exclusion restrictions
that allow us to interpret the equations of structural econometric models.
In his criticism of large-scale macroeconometric models, Sims (1980) referred to
many of the restrictions used to identify macro models as “incredible”. He observed:
“the extent to which the distinctions among equations in large macromodels are nor-
malizations, rather than truly structural distinctions, has not received much emphasis”
[Sims (1980, p. 3)]. By truly structural distinctions, Sims meant exclusion and other
functional form restrictions derived from economic theory. This same criticism clearly
applies to structural modeling of the relationship between profits and concentration. As
we describe in later sections, the lack of satisfactory answers to such questions is what
led some empirical IO economists to look more closely at what economic theory had to
say about firm profitability and market concentration.
3.5. The role of nonexperimental data in structural modeling
Virtually all data used in empirical economic research comes from nonexperimental set-
tings. The use of nonexperimental data can raise significant additional modeling issues
for descriptive and structural modelers. Consider a researcher who wants to describe the
relationship between firms’ prices and the number of competitors. Suppose that the data
under consideration come from markets where firms face a price cap. The most general
approach to describing this relationship would be to estimate flexibly the joint distrib-
ution of prices and competitors. Provided the price cap is binding in some markets, the
researcher would obtain a density that has a spike at the price cap.
Instead of flexibly estimating the joint distribution of prices and competitors, the re-
searchercouldinsteadusearegressiontodescribetherelationship.Aswearguedearlier,
OLS will deliver consistent estimates of the best linear predictor function. Suppose that
absent the cap economic theory implied that the conditional mean of prices given the
number of competitors (x) was linear in x. How does the presence of the cap affect the
estimation of the coefficients of the conditional mean function? The answer is that the
cap truncates the joint distribution and thereby alters the conditional mean of y given x.
Thus, the researcher will need to model this truncation if he is to recover a consistent
estimate of the coefficients in the conditional mean function.4302 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Althoughsimilar statistical samplingissues can arise in structural models, a structural
econometric modeler would view the presence of a price cap as more than a statistical
nuisance. Rather, the cap is something that needs to be accounted for in the modeling
of firm behavior and the unobservables.
To illustrate how structural models can account for nonexperimental data, let us re-
turn to the demand and supply model for prices and quantities. Suppose the researcher
observes price, the total quantity that consumers demand at that price, and consumer
income (x1). Suppose also that the researcher has estimated the regression
qs
t = β0 + β1pt + β2x1t + 1t
by OLS. For the researcher to be able to assert that they have estimated a demand curve,
as opposed to a descriptive best linear predictor, they must be able to argue that price
and income are uncorrelated with the error. When is this likely the case? In principle,
it would be the case if the researcher could perform experiments where they faced all
consumers with a random series of prices. The same experiment also could be used to
estimate a supply equation using OLS, provided the researcher observed the quantity
supplied at the randomly chosen price.
The key feature of the experiment that makes it possible to estimate both the de-
mand and supply equations by OLS is that the researcher observes both the quantity
demanded and the quantity supplied at each randomly chosen price. In general, the
quantity demanded will not equal the quantity supplied at a randomly chosen price. In
other words, the third equation in the demand and supply system (3) does not hold.
How do equilibrium models of price determination compare then to experimental
models? One way to view nonexperimental data is that it came from a grand experi-
ment. Imagine that in this grander experiment, the experimentalist had collected data
for a vast range of randomly selected prices, incomes and input prices. Imagine now
someone else extracts from the experimentalist’s data only those observations in which
the experimenter’s randomly chosen prices, incomes and input prices resulted in the
quantity supplied equaling the quantity demanded. This nonrandom sample selection
would yield a data set with significantly less information and, more importantly, non-
random prices. Thus, even though the original data came from a random experiment,
the data selection process will cause OLS to no longer deliver consistent estimates of
the supply and demand parameters. On the other hand, if the researcher were to ap-
ply instrumental variable techniques appropriate for a structural simultaneous equations
model that (correctly) imposed the market-clearing equation (3), they would obtain con-
sistent estimates.
Our general point here is that structural models are valuable in nonexperimental con-
texts because they force the researcher to grapple directly with nonexperimental aspects
of data. Consider again the demand and supply model above. How did we know it was
appropriate to impose qs = qd? The answer came not from a statistical model of the
nonrandomness, but from our economic perspective on the nonexperimental data – we
assumedthatthedatacamefrommarketswheretherearenopricefloorsorceilings.HadCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4303
therebeenpricefloorsorceilings,thiswouldchangethethirdequationinoureconomet-
ric model. For example, with binding price ceilings, we might assume that the quantity
we observe is the quantitysupplied. (With a bindingceiling, quantitydemandedexceeds
supply, but we typically would not know by how much.) Our econometric model now
wouldhavetoaccountforthisselectionofquantities.Avarietyofsuch“disequilibrium”
demand and supply models exist and are reviewed in Maddala (1983).
4. A framework for structural econometric models in IO
Having described differences between descriptive and structural models, we now pro-
vide a framework for building and evaluating structural econometric models. While in
principle it would seem easy for empiricists to recast an economic model as an econo-
metric model, this has not proven true in practice. The process of combining economic
and statistical models is by no means formulaic. As we have indicated earlier, the
process of building a tractable econometric model that respects the institutions being
modeled often involves difficult trade-offs. In the remaining sections we will use the
framework to illustrate the progress of structural modeling in IO.
Structural modeling, and the elements of our framework, are not new to IO or most
applied fields in economics. More than fifty years ago, Trygve Haavelmo and econo-
mists at the Cowles Foundation began combining models of individual agent behavior
with stochastic specifications describing what the econometrician does not know:
The method of econometric research aims, essentially, at a conjunction of eco-
nomic theory and actual measurements, using the theory and technique of statis-
tical inference as a bridge pier. ...So far, the common procedure has been to first
constructaneconomictheoryinvolvingexactfunctionalrelationships,thentocom-
pare this theory with some actual measurements, and finally “to judge” whether the
correspondence is “good” or “bad”. Tools of statistical inference have been intro-
duced, in some degree, to support such judgment ...[Haavelmo (1944, p. iii)]
While the general principle of combining economic models with stochastic specifica-
tions has been around for some time,each field of economics has had to confront its own
problems of how best to combine models with data. Often the desire to have a simple,
well-defined probability model of the endogenous variables forces compromises. Early
on, Hood and Koopmans described the challenge facing empirical economists as:
In reality, unobserved random variables need to be introduced to represent
“shocks” in behavior relations (i.e., the aggregate effects on economic decisions
of numerous variables that are not separately observed) and “errors” of measure-
ment. The choice of assumptions as to the distribution of these random variables
is further complicated by the fact that the behavior equations in question are often
aggregated over firms or individuals. The implications of this fact are insufficiently
explored so far. [Hood and Koopmans (1953, p. xv)]4304 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Following in this tradition, we describe a procedure for structural economic model-
ing that contains three basic steps. The first step is to formulate a well-defined economic
model of the environment under consideration. The second step involves adding a suf-
ficient number of stochastic unobservables to the economic model, so that its solution
produces a joint density for all observables that has positive support on all possible
realizations of these variables. The final step involves verifying the adequacy of the
resulting structural econometric model as a description of the observed data.
4.1. The economic model
The first main component of a structural model is a complete specification of the equa-
tions describing economic behavior, what we call the economic model. Almost all
economic models in IO have the following five components:
1. A description of the economic environment, including:
(a) the extent of the market and its institutions;
(b) the economic actors; and
(c) the information available to each actor.
2. A list of primitives, including:
(a) technologies (e.g., production sets);
(b) preferences (e.g., utility functions); and
(c) endowments (e.g., assets).
3. Variables exogenous to agents and the economic environment, including:
(a) constraints on agents’ behavior; and
(b) variables outside the model that alter the behavior of economic agents.
4. The decision variables, time horizons and objective functions of agents, such as:
(a) utility maximization by consumers and quantity demanded; and
(b) profit maximization by firms and quantity supplied.
5. An equilibrium solution concept, such as:
(a) Walrasian equilibrium with price-taking behavior by consumers; and
(b) Nash equilibrium with strategic quantity or price selection by firms.
Whiletherigorofmathematicsforcestheoriststobeclearaboutthesecomponentswhen
they build an economic model, structural econometric models differ considerably in the
extent to which they spell out these components. Our later discussions will illustrate the
value of trying to make these components clear. In particular, we will focus attention
on component 5, the equilibrium solution concept, because this is the most critical and
specific to IO models.
4.2. The stochastic model
The next step in structural modeling is unique to empirical research. It receives much
less attention than it deserves. This step is the process by which one transforms a de-
terministic (or stochastic) economic model into an econometric model. An econometricCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4305
model is distinct from an economic model in that it includes unobservables that ac-
count for the fact that the economic model does not perfectly fit observed data. Our
main point is that the process of introducing errors should not be arbitrary. Both the
source and properties of these errors can have a critical impact on the distribution of the
observed endogenous variables and estimation.
The four principal ways in which a researcher can introduce stochastic components
into a deterministic economic model are:
1. researcher uncertainty about the economic environment;
2. agent uncertainty about the economic environment;
3. optimization errors on the part of economic agents; and
4. measurement errors in observed variables.
This subsection emphasizes how these stochastic specifications differ, and in particular
how they can affect the manner by which the researcher goes about estimating structural
parameters.
4.2.1. Unobserved heterogeneity and agent uncertainty
A researcher’s uncertainty about the economic environment can take a variety of forms.
These different forms can have dramatically different implications for identification and
estimation. For this reason it is critical for structural modelers to explain where error
terms come from and whose uncertainty they represent. A critical distinction that needs
to be drawn in almost every instance is: Is the uncertainty being introduced shared by
the economic actors and econometrician?
A common assumption is that the researcher knows much less about the economic
environment than the economic agents. In this case, the economic agents base their
decisions on information that the researcher can only include in an error term. For
example, if the researcher did not observe auction bidders’ private information about
an object, then the researcher would be forced to model how this unobservable in-
formation impacted bids. In general, we refer to a situation where agents’ decisions
depend on something the economist does not observe as a case of unobserved hetero-
geneity.
Of course researchers and economic agents can share uncertainty about the economic
environment under study. For instance, the bidder may know their value for an object,
but not the private values of the other bidders. In each of these cases, the firm or agent is
presumed to know the distribution of uncertainty and make decisions that optimize the
expected value of an objective function.
It might seem that because the econometrician is ignorant in both cases that unob-
served heterogeneity and agent uncertainty are two sides of the same coin – they both
rationalize introducing error terms in a structural model. The distinction, however, often
is important for determining which estimation procedure is appropriate. To underscore
this point, we now return to the two models described in (2). We shall show that, de-4306 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
pending on our assumptions about the source of the errors, it may be appropriate to
regress lnTC on lnQ and other controls, or lnQ on lnTC and these same controls.
EXAMPLE 6. Imagine that we have cross-section data on comparable firms consisting
of output, Q, total costs, TC, and input prices, pK and pL. Our goal is to estimate α and
β in the Cobb–Douglas production function
Qi = AiLα
i K
β
i
consistently, where the subscript i denotes the ith firm. Because we do not have labor
and capital information, we need to derive a relationship between total costs and output.
There are many possible ways of doing this, each dependingon what additionalassump-
tions we make about the economic environment in which firms make their decisions.
Suppose, for example, that the firms are in a regulated industry, and have different Ai.
For the purposes of exposition, assume that demand is completely inelastic. Consider
now the case of pure unobserved heterogeneity (Type 1 shocks), where Ai is observed
by the firm and the regulator, but not the econometrician. For simplicity, assume the Ai
are i.i.d. positive random variables. Firm profits equal:
π(pi,Ki,Li) = piAiLα
i K
β
i − pKiKi − pLiLi.
Suppose that the regulator chooses pi, the price of firm i’s output first, and the firm then
chooses Ki and Li. Because demand is inelastic, a regulator interested in maximizing
consumer welfare will set the firm’s output price equal to the minimum average cost of
producing Qi. At this price, pr
i , the firm chooses its inputs to minimize costs given the
regulator’s price and Qi. That is, the firm maximizes
π(Ki,Li) = pr
i AiLα
i K
β
i − pKiKi − pLiLi.
Solving the firm’s profit-maximizing problem, yields the total cost function:
(14) TCi = C0p
γ
Kip
1−γ
Li Qδ
i A−δ
i ,
relating firm i’s observed total cost data to its output. In this equation, δ = 1/(α + β)
and γ = β/(α+β). We can transform this total cost function into a regression equation
using natural logarithms:
(15) lnTCi = lnC0 + γ lnpKi + (1 − γ)lnpLi + δ lnQi − δ lnAi.
While this equation holds exactly for the firm, the researcher does not observe the Ai.
The researcher thus must treat the efficiency differences as unobservable in this loga-
rithm of total cost regression:
(16) lnTCi = C1 + γ lnpKi + (1 − γ)lnpLi + δ lnQi − δ lnui.
This regression equation contains the mean zero error term
lnui = lnAi − E[lnAi | lnpKi,lnpLi,lnQi].Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4307
The new constant term C1 = lnC0 + E[lnAi | lnpKi,lnpLi,lnQi] absorbs the
nonzero conditional mean of the efficiency differences. Because the Ai are i.i.d., the
conditional expectation reduces to the unconditional expectation, E[lnAi | lnpKi,
lnpLi,lnQi] = E[lnAi].
To summarize, we have derived a regression equation that is linear in functions of the
(regulated) firm’s production parameters. The relationship includes an error term that
represents the firms’ unobserved productive efficiencies. This error term explains why,
at the same output level and input prices, firms could have different total costs. What is
left to explain, is how a researcher would estimate the production parameters. This is a
nontrivial issue in general. Here it is possible to argue that under fairly weak assump-
tions on the distribution of the ui we can use ordinary least squares (OLS) to recover the
production parameters. Note that OLS is appropriate because we have assumed that the
regulator (and not the firm) picks price to recover the firm’s minimum production cost
to serve output Qi. Put another way, OLS works because the unobserved heterogeneity
in firms’ production efficiencies is unrelated to the left-hand side regressors: firm output
(which is inelastically demanded) and input prices (inputs are elastically supplied).
Now suppose that we observe the same data, but that the firm, like the econometri-
cian, does not know its productive efficiency, Ai. This assumption leads to a different
estimation strategy. In this case, the firm now must make its input decisions before it
knows Ai. As long as the firm cannot undo this choice once Ai is realized, the firm max-
imizes expected profits taking into account the distribution of Ai. Now firm i’s expected
profit function is:
(17) E

π(pi,Li,Ki)



piAiLα


− pKiKi − pLiLi.
We should note here that the expectation operator represents the firm’s expectation.
Assume that the regulator again chooses pi; the firm then chooses Ki and Li. For
simplicity, suppose that the regulator and the firm have the same uncertainty about the
firm’s productive efficiency. Suppose additionally that the regulator sets price, per
i , such
that the firm earns zero profits in expectation. The firm then maximizes:

Observed total costs therefore equal

and do not depend on the firm’s (random) efficiency parameter Ai. Substituting these
two expressions into the production function, we obtain an equation relating the ob-

(21) Qa

From both the firms’ and the econometrician’s perspective, the sole source of random-
ness here is the efficiency parameter Ai. Taking natural logarithms of both sides we
obtain a regression equation that is linear in the production parameters
(22) lnQa
i = lnD0 + (α + β)lnTCi −β lnpKi − α lnpLi + lnAi.
This equation exactly explains firm i’s realized production Qa
i (which differs from the
inelastically demanded quantity Qi). Neither the firms nor the econometrician knows
the Ai ex ante. Because the researcher also does not observe the efficiencies ex post, she
must treat the efficiencies as random errors. She thus estimates the regression
(23) lnQi = D1 + (α + β)lnTCi −β lnpKi − α lnpLi + ηi,
where ηi = lnAi − E[lnAi | lnpKi,lnpLi,lnTCi]. The constant term D1 =
lnD0 + E[lnAi | lnpKi,lnpLi,lnTCi] absorbs the nonzero conditional mean of the
efficiency differences. Once again, using the i.i.d. assumption on the Ai, the conditional
expectation on lnAi simplifies to the unconditional expectation. We can now use OLS
to estimate the production parameters because by assumption the uncertainty in pro-
duction is realized after the firm makes its production decision and is unrelated to total
costs and input prices.
This example illustrates how the structural model’s economic and stochastic assump-
tions can have a critical bearing on the consistency of a particular estimation strategy.
Under one set of economic and stochastic assumptions, OLS applied to Equation (16)
yields consistent estimates of the parameters of the firm’s production function; under
another set, we swap the dependent variable for one independent variable. Both models
assumed (expected) profit-maximizing firms and (expected) welfare-maximizing regu-
lators. In the first case, the stochastic shock represented only the researcher’s ignorance
about the productivity of firms. In the second, case, it represented uncertainty on the
part of the firm, the regulator and the researcher about the productivity of the firm.
This example illustrates our initial point that a researcher should decide between
models based upon how well their economic and stochastic assumptions match the en-
vironmentinwhichtheresearcher’sdataweregenerated.Becausenoeconomicmodelis
perfect in practice, the researcher often will be left choosing among imperfect assump-
tions and models. No statistical test can tell which model is correct. In later sections, we
will discuss in more detail how a researcher might go about choosing among competing
models.
4.2.2. Optimization errors
The third type of error listed above, optimization error, has received the least attention
from structural modelers. In part, optimization errors have received less attention be-
cause there are few formal decision-theoretic models of optimization errors. The errors
we have in mind are best illustrated by the behavior of economic agents in experiments.
Experimental subjects often make errors, even when faced with relatively simple tasks.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4309
Experimentalists’ interpretations of these errors has been the source of considerable
debate (e.g., see Camerer’s (1995) survey). Here, we adopt a narrow view of what op-
timization error means so that we can illustrate the potential significance of such errors
for structural models.
EXAMPLE 7. This example narrowly interprets optimization errors as the failure of
agents’ decisions to satisfy exactly first-order necessary conditions for optimal deci-
sions. We are silent here on what causes this failure, and focus instead on its conse-
quences. As an example, consider the standard consumer demand problem with unob-
served heterogeneity in the utility function:
(24) min
λ⩾0
max
x⩾0
U(x,η) + λ(M − p
x)

,
where x is an n-dimensional vector of consumption goods, p is the vector of prices, and
M is the consumer’s total budget. The vector η represents elements of individual tastes
that the researcher does not observe. The normal first-order condition for xi, assuming
η is known is
(25)
∂U
∂xi
(xi,ηi) − λipi = 0.
These equations yield the i = 1,...,n Marshallian demands, xi(p,M,η). In this case,
the agent’s first-order conditions are assumed to hold with probability one, so that for
all realizations of η, all of the integrability conditions hold for the xi(p,M,η).
Nowsupposethatweintroduceanadditionalsourceoferrorintotheagent’sdemands.
Although there are several ways to introduce error, imagine the errors do not impact the
consumer’s budget constraint (i.e., we still have M = n
i=1 pixi), but do impact the
first-order conditions (25). Specifically, suppose
(26)
∂U
∂xi
(x,η) − λpiνi = 0.
The researcher does not observe the νi, and thus treats them as random variables. Sup-
pose for convenience that the researcher believes these errors have positive support and
a mean of one in the population, so that on average the first-order conditions are cor-
rect.
How do the νi impact agents’ decisions? If we solve the first-order conditions, and
use the budget constraint, we obtain the Marshallian demand functions xi(p,M,η,ν).
Although the “demand curves” that result from this process satisfy homogeneity of
degree zero in prices and total expenditure, they do not necessarily have a negative
semi-definite Slutsky matrix for all realizations of the vector ν.
The next example shows how optimization errors can be used to rationalize why
two seemingly identical consumers who face the same prices may purchase different
amounts of x and y.4310 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
EXAMPLE 8. Imagine that we have demand data from a cross-section of similar con-
sumers, all of whom have the same budget M, which they spend on two goods x and y.
How should we model the differences in their consumption? One possible modeling
strategy would be to say consumers have different preferences. Another would be to
assume consumers have the same preference function, but that they make optimization
errors when they make decisions.
Suppose each consumer has the utility function U(x,y) = xayb and that the first-
order conditions have the form given in (26). Solving the first-order conditions, yields
(27)
a
x
= λpxνxi,
b
y
= λpyνyi, pxx + pyy = M,
where λ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the budget constraint and νxi and νyi
are positive random variables representing optimization errors for consumer i. Further
algebra yields
(28) λ =
αi + βi
M
with αi =
a
νxi
and βi =
b
νyi
,
(29) x =
αi
αi + βi
M

and y =
βi
αi + βi

.
These demand functions look exactly like what we would get if there were no op-
timization error, and we had instead started with the Cobb–Douglas utility function
U(x,y) = xαi yβi . In other words, if we had started the modeling exercise by assuming
that consumers did not make optimization errors, but instead had Cobb–Douglas prefer-
enceswithheterogeneousutilityparameters,wewouldhaveobtainedanobservationally
equivalent demand model. The only way we might be able to distinguish between the
two views would be to have data on consumers’ choices across different purchase occa-
sions. In this case, if consumers’ tastes were time invariant, but their optimization errors
varied intertemporally, we could in principle distinguish between optimization error and
unobserved heterogeneity in tastes.
Optimization errors also can reduce the perceived rationality of agents’ behavior. The
following example shows that the way in which optimization errors are introduced can
affect the extent to which firms are observed to be optimizing.
EXAMPLE 9. Consider a set of firms that have the common production function
Q = LαKβ. Suppose each firm makes optimization errors when it attempts to minimize
production costs. Specifically, assume that the factor demand functions are generated by
solving the following three equations:
(30) pLνL = λαKβ
Lα−1
, pKνK = λβKβ−1
Lα
, and Q = Kβ
Lα
,
where λ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint that the firm produces
using the production function, and νLi and νKi are unit mean, positive random vari-
ables representing optimization errors for firm i. Solving these three equations yieldsCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4311
following two factor demands:
(31) L = Q

An implication of the optimization errors, νLi and νKi, is that the symmetry restriction
implied by cost-minimization behavior fails. Specifically, the restriction
(33)
∂L
∂pK
=
∂K
∂pL
does not hold. Consequently, despite the fact that factor demands honor the feasibility
constraint implied by the production function, they do not satisfy all of the restrictions
implied by optimizing behavior.
Depending on how optimization errors are introduced, varying degrees of rational-
ity can be imposed on factor demand and consumer demand systems. For example,
optimization errors can be introduced in such a way as to yield consumer demands
that satisfy the budget constraint and nothing else. This is another way of making Gary
Becker’s (1962) point that much of the apparent rationality in economic behavior comes
from imposing a budget constraint or a technological constraint on what otherwise
amounts to irrational behavior.
This discussion of optimization errors has hopefully demonstrated the extremely
important and often overlooked point: the addition of disturbances to deterministic be-
havioral relationships is not innocuous. Depending on how this is done, a well-defined
deterministic economic model can be transformed into an incoherent statistical model.
For example, if the random disturbances in Equation (26) are allowed to take on values
less than zero, for certain realizations of ν this system of first-order conditions may not
have a solution in x and λ, or may have multiple solutions. Because of these concerns,
we recommend that the underlying economic model be formulated with the stochastic
structure included, rather than including random shocks into a deterministic model as
an afterthought.
4.2.3. Measurement error
Besides these sources of error, structural models also may include measurement errors.
Measurement errors occur when the variables the researcher observes are different from
those the agents observe. In most cases, it is impossible for researchers to distinguish
measurement error from the three other sources of error. As we shall see below, this
distinction is nevertheless important, having significant implications not only for esti-
mation and testing, but also for policy evaluations.4312 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Measurementerrors also occurinexogenousvariables. Unfortunately,thesemeasure-
ment errors often are ignored even though they can be a much greater source of concern.
For example, measurement errors in the regressors of a linear regression model will
destroy the consistency of OLS. Attempts to handle measurement error in exogenous
variables often are frustrated by the fact that there typically is little prior information
abouttheproperties of the measurementerror. This means thatthe researcher must pred-
icate any solution on untestable assumptions about the measurement error. As a result,
most researchers only acknowledge measurement error in an exogenous variable when
they think that the measurement error constitutes a large component of the variation in
the exogenous variable.
Measurement error can serve useful purposes in structural econometricmodeling. For
example,measurementerrorcanmakewhatwouldotherwisebeanincoherentstructural
model coherent. Consider the case where consumers face nonlinear budget sets. Sup-
pose a consumer must pay $1 per unit for the first 10 units consumed and then $10 per
unit for all units beyond the tenth unit consumed. Given the large difference in price
between the tenth and eleventh units, we would expect that many consumers would pur-
chase exactly 10 units. In real data, we often do not see dramatic spikes in consumption
when marginal prices increase. One way to account for this is to assume that actual
consumption is measured with error. This is consistent with the theoretical model’s pre-
diction of a probability mass at exactly 10 units, but our not observing a large number
of consumers consuming exactly ten units.
Measurement error also is a straightforward way of converting a deterministic eco-
nomic model into a statistical model. In Example 1, for instance, we introduced mea-
surement errors to justify applying OLS to what otherwise should have been a determin-
istic relation. However, as we also noted in Example 1, it is usually unrealistic to assume
that measurement error is the only source of error. In general, measurement error should
be introduced as one of several possible sources of error.
4.3. Steps to estimation
Givenawell-definedstochasticmodel,thenextpartofourframeworkistoaddanypara-
metric and distributional assumptions necessary to finalize the model. The researcher
then is in a position to select an estimation technique and to formulate, where possible,
tests of maintained assumptions. We think of this process as having four interrelated
selections:
1. selection of functional forms;
2. selection of distributional assumptions;
3. selection of an estimation technique; and
4. selection of specification tests.
There are several criteria a researcher should keep in mind when choosing a functional
form. One of the most important is that there is a trade-off between data availability
and parametric flexibility. Larger datasets usually allow greater parametric flexibility.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4313
A second criterion is that the functional form should be economically realistic. To take
an extreme example, if we are interested in estimating an input elasticity of substitu-
tion, then a Cobb–Douglas production function will not work. While this is an extreme
case, the structural modeling literature contains nontrivial examples where the func-
tional form almost entirely delivers the desired empirical result.
A third criterion is ease of estimation. If a specific functional form results in a model
that is easier to estimate, that should certainly be a factor in its favor. Similarly, if one
functional form makes it easier to impose economic restrictions than another, then that
too should favor its selection. As an example, it is very easy to impose homogeneity of
degree one in input prices on a translog production function. This is not the case for a
quadratic cost function. A final criterion is estimation transparency. In some cases, it
pays to select a functional form that leads to simpler estimation techniques. This has
the advantage of making it easier for other researchers to understand how the researcher
arrived at their estimates.
Turning now to the choice of distributional assumptions, a researcher’s stochastic
specification may or may not involve a complete set of distributional assumptions. To
the extent that the researcher is willing to completely specify the distribution of the
model errors, the structural model implies a conditional distribution of the observed
endogenous variables given the exogenous variables. At this point the researcher can
consider using maximum likelihood, or a similar technique (e.g., simulated maximum
likelihood or the EM algorithm) to estimate the parameters of interest.
As a specific example, consider an optimizing model of producer behavior. Suppose
the economic model specifies a functional form for π(y,x,,β) – a firm’s profit func-
tion as a function of outputs produced and inputs consumed, y; a vector of input and
output prices, x; the vector of firm characteristics observable to the firm but not the re-
searcher, ; and a vector of parameters to be estimated, β. If the firm maximizes profits
by choosing y, we have the first-order conditions
(34)
∂π(y,x,,β)
∂y
= 0.
Assuming that the inverse function y = h(x,,β) exists and assuming the only source
of error, , has the density, f(,θ), we can apply the change-of-variables formula to
compute the density of y from the density of the unobservable 
(35) p(y | x,θ,β) = f h−1
(y,x,β),θ




∂h−1(y,x,β)

.
This density can be used to construct the likelihood function for each observation of y.
The final two items on our list include familiar issues in estimation and testing. An
advantage of using maximum likelihood in the previous example is that it would be
clear to other researchers how the elements of the economic and stochastic models led
to the estimation method. There are of course costs to being this complete. One is that
maximum likelihood estimators may be difficult to compute. A second is that there
is a trade-off between efficiency and robustness. Maximum likelihood techniques may4314 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
be inconsistent if not all of the distributional assumptions hold. Generalized method of
moments and other estimation techniques may impose fewer restrictions on the distribu-
tion of , but also may yield less efficient estimates. It also is the case that alternatives to
maximum likelihood may not allow the estimation of some parameters. This is a corol-
lary to our earlier point about structure. In some instances, the researcher’s economic
structure exists only because of distributional assumptions. In subsequent sections, we
will illustrate how distributional assumptions can identify economic primitives.
Once the researcher obtains estimates of the structural model, it is important to
examine, where possible, any restrictions implied by a structural model’s economic
and stochastic assumptions. In addition, it is useful to examine, where possible, how
sensitive estimates are to particular assumptions. Thus, if the researcher has used instru-
mental variable methods to estimate a model, and there are over-identifying restrictions,
then these restrictions should be tested. If a researcher assumes an error term is white
noise, then tests for heteroscedastic and/or autocorrelated errors are appropriate. As for
thesensitivityofestimates,theresearchercancheckwhetheradditionalvariablesshould
be included, or whether other functional form assumptions are too restrictive. Although
it is extremely difficult to determine the appropriate nominal size for these specification
tests, it is still worthwhile to compute the magnitude of these test statistics to assess the
extent to which the structural model estimated is inconsistent with the observed data.
Once the structural model is shown not to be “wildly” inconsistent with the observed
data, the researcher is ready to use this structural model to answer the sorts of questions
discussed in Section 2 and this section.
4.4. Structural model epilogue
An important premise in what follows is that no structural analysis should go forward
without a convincing argument that the potential insights of the structural model exceed
the costs of restrictive or untestable assumptions. Knowing how to trade off these costs
and benefits is critical to knowing whether it makes sense to develop and estimate a
structural econometric model. We hope that our framework and our discussion of the
IO literature will provide some sense of the “art” involved in building and evaluating
structural models.
In what follows, we propose to show how researchers in IO have used structural
econometric models. Our purpose is not to provide a complete survey of IO. There
already are several excellent literature surveys of areas such as auctions and firm com-
petition. We propose instead to provide a sense of how IO empiricists have gone about
combining game-theoretic economic models and statistical models to produce struc-
tural econometric models. We also aim to provide a sense of how far IO researchers
are in solving important econometric issues posed by game-theoretic models. In our
discussions, we hope to convey that structural modeling should be more than high-tech
statistics applied to economic data. Indeed, we aim to show through examples how the
economic question being answered should motivate the choice of technique (rather than
the other way around).Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4315
5. Demand and cost function estimation under imperfect competition
In this section, we discuss Porter’s (1983) empirical model of competition in an
oligopoly market. We begin with Porter’s model for several reasons. First, it was one
of the first to estimate a game-theoretic model of competition. Second, the model
bears a strong resemblance to the classical demand and supply model we discussed
in Section 3. Third, we think it is an excellent example of how structural econometric
modeling should be undertaken. In the process of reviewing his model, we hope to il-
lustrate how our framework can help identify the essential ingredients of a structural
model.
5.1. Using price and quantity data to diagnose collusion
One of the most important research topics in IO is how to measure the extent of compe-
tition in an industry. This question is of more than academic interest, as policy makers
and the courts often are called upon to assess the extent of intra-industry competition.
Additionally, when policymakers or the courts find there is insufficient competition,
they must go a step further and propose remedies that will prevent firms from colluding
or exercising excessive unilateral market power.
Economistsseektoinferthepresenceorabsenceofcompetitionfromotherdata,most
frequently data on prices and quantities. Sometimes these studies are conducted using
firm-level or product-level price and quantity information, and sometimes economists
only have industry price and quantity data. The central message of the next several
sections is:
TheinferencesthatIOresearchers’drawaboutcompetitionfrompriceandquantity
data rest on what the researchers assume about demand, costs, and the nature of
firms’ unobservable strategic interactions.
It is therefore essential to evaluate how each of these components affects a researcher’s
ability to use nonexperimental price and quantity data to identify the extent of competi-
tion in an industry.
The demand specification plays a critical role in competition models because its po-
sition, shape and sensitivity to competitors’ actions affects a firm’s ability to mark up
price above cost. The IO literature typically draws a distinction between demand mod-
els for homogeneous products and differentiated products. In this section we consider
homogeneous product models in which firms’ products are perfect substitutes and there
is a single industry price. In this case, industry demand has the general form
(36) Q = h(P,Z,β,ν),
where Q is total industry quantity, P is industry price, Z are market demand variables,
β are parameters that affect the shape and position of market demand, and ν is a mar-
ket demand error. This demand function is an economic primitive. By itself it tells us
nothing about firm behavior or the extent of competition. Inferences about the extent4316 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
of competition, however, are inextricably linked to what the researcher assumes about
demand. This is because the demand curve enters into firms’ profit-maximizing quantity
or price decisions.
To model firms’ price or quantity decisions, the researcher must first take a stand
on the form of firms’ profit functions, specifically the functional forms of market
demand and firm-level costs. Once these are specified, the researcher must then intro-
duce assumptions about how firms interact (e.g., Cournot versus Bertrand). Combining
these assumptions with the assumption of expected profit-maximizing behavior yields
first-order conditions that characterize firms’ optimal price or quantity decisions. This
“structure” in turn affects the industry “supply” equation that the researcher would use
to draw inferences about competition.
In some, but not all, cases it is possible to parameterize the impact of competition on
firms’ first-order conditions in such a way that they aggregate to an industry price or
“supply” equation:
(37) P = g(Q,W,θ,η),
where W are variables that enter the firms’ cost functions, θ are parameters that affect
the shape and position of the firms’ cost curves and possibly describe their competitive
interactions, and η is an error term.
Equations (36) and (37) look like nonlinear versions of the simultaneous linear equa-
tions in (3) of Example 3. Both sets of equations describe equilibrium industry prices
and quantities. The chief difference is that in an oligopolistic setting, the “supply”
equation is not an aggregate marginal cost curve but an aggregation of firm first-order
conditions for profit-maximization in which firms mark price up above marginal cost.
The extent to which price is above marginal cost depends on firms’ competitive inter-
actions. The critical issue is: What about the demand and “supply” equations identifies
the extent of competition from observations on prices and quantities?
Porter’s study provides a useful vehicle for understanding the assumptions necessary
to identify the extent of competition from industry price and quantity data. In particular,
his study makes it clear that without imposing specific functional form restrictions on
market demand and industry supply, we have no hope of estimating the market demand
curve or firm cost curves. This is because the researcher only observes pairs of prices
and quantities that solve (36) and (37). Even when the researcher is willing to make
distributional assumptions about the joint density of ν and η, without assumptions on
the functional form of (36) and (37), the assumption that P and Q are equilibrium
magnitudes only implies that there is conditional density of P and Q given Z and W.
Consequently, if the researcher is unwilling to make any parametric assumptions for
the demand and supply equations, he would, at best, be able to only recover the joint
density of P and Q given Z and W using the flexible smoothing techniques described
earlier. Only by making parametric assumptions for the supply and demand equations
can these two equations be separately identified and estimated from market-clearing
prices and quantities. This is precisely the strategy that Porter (1983) and all subsequentCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4317
researchers take in estimating the competitiveness of a market from equilibrium price
and quantity data.
Rosse (1970) first estimated the extent of unilateral market power possessed by a firm
from market-clearing price and quantity, using a sample of monopoly markets. Porter’s
1983 study of nineteenth century US railroad cartels is one of the first papers in IO to
devise a structural econometric model of a cartelized industry.3 The economic logic for
Porter’sempiricalmodelcomesfromGreenandPorter(1984).GreenandPorterexplore
the idea that cartels might use price wars to discipline members who deviate from cartel
prices or output quotas. Specifically, Green and Porter develop a dynamic model of a
homogeneous product market in which potential cartel members face random shocks to
industry demand. By assumption, firms never perfectly observe demand or other firms’
output decisions. In this noisy environment, cartel participants have trouble identifying
whether lower prices are the result of a breakdown in the cartel or low demand. Green
and Porter’s work shows that firms can support a cartel by agreeing to a period of com-
petitive pricing of a pre-determined length whenever market prices fall below a trigger
price.
In what follows, we use our framework to discuss the components of Porter’s model.
In particular, we focus on the assumptions that allow Porter to identify competitive
pricing regimes. In the process, we hope to illustrate many of our earlier points about
structural models. The main lessons we take away from Porter’s analysis is that it is
impossible to identify the extent of market power exercised by a firm or in an industry
from a descriptive data analysis. It is also impossible to determine definitively whether
firms are colluding from this sort of data analysis. Inferences about the extent of mar-
ket power exercised, or the presence and pervasiveness of collusion, rest heavily on
untestable economic, functional form and stochastic assumptions. In general, it is not
possible to test all these assumptions. The strength of Porter’s equilibrium model in
which the cartel switches between monopoly and competitive prices is that it is possible
to see what is needed to identify monopoly versus competitive regimes.
5.2. The economic model
5.2.1. Environment and primitives
Porter begins, as does most of the structural IO literature, by outlining a static, homoge-
neous product oligopoly model where the number of firms (entrants) N is exogenously
given. All firms know the functional form of market demand and each others’ costs.
In Porter’s homogeneous product model, there is a single, constant elasticity industry
demand curve at each period t:
(38) lnQt = α +  lnPt + Z
tγ + νt,
3 See Bresnahan (1989) for a detailed survey of early work on estimating market power.4318 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
where Q is industry output, P is industry price, Z is a vector of exogenous demand
shifters, γ is a conformable vector of unknown coefficients,  is a time-invariant price
elasticity of demand, and νt is an error term. It appears that Porter uses a constant
elasticity demand function because it considerably simplifies subsequent calculations
and estimation. Data limitations also limit Zt to one exogenous variable, a dummy for
whether competing shipping routes on the Great Lakes were free of ice. Although he
does not discuss the source of the demand error term, it plausible to imagine that it is
included to account for demand factors observable to firms but not to Porter.
Each firm has fixed costs of Fi and a constant elasticity variable cost function of the
form
(39) Ci(qit) = aiqδ
it,
where i indexes firms, t indexes time and q is firm-level output. The motivation for
this firm-level cost function appears to be that it delivers an industry “supply” or output
curve for a range models of competition.
Porter leaves portions of the economic environment unspecified. Although competing
shippers are mentioned, their impact on the railroads is not explicitly modeled. Simi-
larly, although entry by railroads occurs during the sample, the entry decisions are not
modeled. (Entry is accounted for by an exogenous shift in the industry supply curve.)
Finally, although Porter does not include unobservables in the individual cost functions,
as we show below it is possible to rationalize part of the error term that he includes in
the industry supply curve as a variable cost component common to all firms that he does
not observe.
5.2.2. Behavior and optimization
Porter assumes that each period (one week), firms maximize their per-period profits
choosing shipping quantities, qit. Additionally, he assumes each firm forms a conjecture
about how other firms will respond to changes in its quantity during that week, θit.
From these behavioral assumptions, Porter derives the standard marginal revenue equals
marginal cost quantity-setting first-order conditions for profit maximization by each
firm:

Although we discuss conjectural parameters in more detail in the next section, one
way to think about the conjectural variation parameter is that it indexes how far price is
from marginal cost. If the firm chooses its output assuming it has no influence on market
price, then it perceives that any increase in output will be met with an equal and opposite
change in the aggregate output of its competitors so that market prices are unchanged.
This means ∂Q−it
∂qit
= −1, so that θit equals zero and price equals marginal cost, which
implies that the firm assumes it is unable to affect the market price through its quantity-
setting actions. For static Cournot–Nash competitors, ∂Q−it
∂qit
= 0, which implies that θit
equals firm i’s quantity share of the market. For a quantity or price-setting monopoly
or cartel, the firm knows that all firms will respond one-for-one with its output change
from their current level of output, so that ∂Q−it
∂qit
= Q−it
qit
, and θit equals one. This value of
θit implies monopoly pricing on the part of the cartel. Although in principle conjectural
variation parameters can continuously range between zero and one, it is unclear what
behavioral meaning one would attach to all other values of θit in this interval besides
the three values described above.
While Porter’s economic model applies to individual firm decisions, he chooses not
to estimate firm-level models. This decision appears to be made because estimating
firm-level specifications would add significantly to his computations, particularly if he
estimated conjectural variation and cost parameters for each firm. Given the state of
computing power at the time he estimated his model, we doubt this would have been
computationally feasible. Additionally, such an approach would require him to model
new entry during the sample period.
As is common when only industry-level price and quantity data are available, Porter
instead aggregates the firm-level first-order conditions to obtain an industry supply
equation of the form (37). This approach, while reducing the number of estimating
equations, is not without limitations. In aggregating the first-order conditions, it quickly
becomes clear that one cannot estimate separate conjectural and cost parameters for
each firm and time period. To reduce the dimensionality of the parameters in the indus-
try supply function, Porter assumes that the firm-level values of θit times the associated
market shares are the same (unknown) constant. This assumption has the important
computational advantage of reducing the number of conjectural and cost parameters to
two. Moreover, it makes it easy to calculate equilibrium prices and quantities in per-
fectly competitive and monopoly (collusive) markets. It should not be surprising that
this simplifying assumption has disadvantages. The two main ones are that the model
is now inconsistent with a Cournot market outcome and it is unclear why conjectural
parameters should vary inversely with market shares.
Porter obtains his supply equation by weighting each firm’s first-order condition in
(40) by its quantity,

and sit = qit/Qt is the quantity share of firm i in time t. Taking the natural log of
this equation yields the aggregate supply function that Porter estimates, apart from the
addition of an error term.
At this point, it is useful to summarize Porter’s structural model. The main attraction
of Porter’s assumptions are that they result in a two-equation linear (in the parameters)
system that explains equilibrium industry price and quantity data:
(44)
lnQt −  lnpt = α + Ztγ + νt Demand Equation,
−(δ − 1)ln(Qt) + lnpt = λ + βIt + Wtφ + ηt Supply Equation,
where λ = lnD, β = −ln(1 + θ/), It is an indicator random variable which takes
on the value 1 when the industry is in a cooperative regime and 0 when the industry
is in a competitive regime, Wt is a set of explanatory variables that capture aggre-
gate supply shifts due to such events as the entry of new firms, and β is an unknown
parameter that measures the extent to which price and quantities sold during the col-
lusive regime approach the joint profit-maximizing monopoly solution. For example,
if β = −ln(1 + 1/), the collusive regime involves joint profit maximization. Lower
values of β, however, imply higher output in the collusive regime. Porter argues based
on his work with Green, that the true β should be less than the joint profit-maximizing
value.
5.2.3. The stochastic model
Porter completes the economic model above with two sets of stochastic assumptions.
The first set is fairly standard: he assumes the errors in the demand and industry supply
equations are additive, mean zero, homoscedastic normal errors. The source of these
errors is left unspecified. One presumes that each error represents demand and cost
factors unobservable to modern researchers, but observable to the firms at the time.
Porter also assumes the demandand supply errors are independentof the right-hand side
exogenous variables. By inspection of the aggregated first-order conditions for profit-
maximization in Equation (41), we can see that the supply shock can be rationalized as a
common multiplicative supply shock to all firms’ variable cost functions. For example,
if we redefine ai in the variable cost function for firm i as αit = ai exp(ηt), then solving
the first-order conditions for each firm and solving for the aggregate supply function,
would yield supply functions with the stochastic shock, ηt, given above.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4321
The second stochastic specification Porter adds is less conventional and is motivated
by an identification problem. In principle, Porter would like to use data on It, which
indicates when the cartel was effective, to estimate β (and thereby recover the price–
cost markup parameter θ). Unfortunately, he has incomplete historical information on
when the cartel was effective. Although he uses some of this information to compare
prices and evaluate his model ex post, in his main estimations he treats It as a random
variable that is observable to the firms but not to him. Thus, in effect the error term in
the supply equation becomes βIt + ηt. Absent further information on It, it is clear that
we have an identification problem – we cannot separately recover the key parameters
θ and λ. This problem is akin to having two constant terms in the same regression. To
see the problem, notice that the expected value of the error (assuming ηt has mean zero)
is βE(It). This expectation is by assumption nonzero because E(It) is the expected
value of It, which equals the probability that the firms are colluding. Assuming this
probability does not change over the sample, which is assumed by Porter’s formulation,
the nonzero average error is absorbed into the supply equation’s constant term, giving
λ + E(It) = λ + βτ, where τ equals the probability that It equals one. The supply
disturbance becomes β(It − τ) + ηt. As we can see from the constant term, even if we
know the constant β, we cannot separately estimate λ and τ.
To gain another perspective on identification issues in Porter’s model, it is useful to
compare Porter’s model to the linear demand and supply model (3), discussed in the
previous section. Porter’s demand and supply system has the form

in Equation (45) by three-stage least squares.
Notice, however, that in the above formulation, the regime-shift variable It only
appears in the error term. This suggests that in order to distinguish between Porter’s
regime-switching model and the classical model, we need to rely on the distributional
assumptions Porter imposes on It, ηt and νt. Absent specific distributional assumptions
for It and ηt, we have no hope of estimating the probability of regime shifts, τ, or the
magnitudeoftheconductparameterduringthesecollusiveregimes,θ,whichisanonlin-
ear function of β, from the joint distribution of price and quantity data. To identify these
parameters, Porter needs to add assumptions. This should not be too surprising given4322 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
that he does not observe It. His strategy for achieving identification is to parameterize
the distribution of the unobservable regimes. Specifically, he assumes that It follows an
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli process and that the νt and ηt
are i.i.d. jointly normally distributed errors. Further, Porter assumes the demand and
supply errors are independent of It. These assumptions allow him to identify λ and β
separately.
The advantage of Porter’s structural framework is that we can explore how these as-
sumptions facilitate identification and estimation. By modeling It as an unobservable
Bernoulli, Porter has introduced a nonnormality into the distribution of the structural
model’s errors. To see this, notice that conditional on the regime, the second element
of Et possesses a symmetric normal distribution. Unconditionally, however, the distri-
bution of Et now is composed of a (centered) Bernoulli and a normal random variable.
Consequently, unlike the traditional demand and supply model (3) where we could use
standard instrumental variables to recover the relevant structural parameters from con-
ditional mean functions, here we must use more information about the joint distribution
of prices and quantities to estimate the model parameters. Put another way, it is the
nonnormality of the reduced form errors that determines the extent to which one can
identify β empirically. This then raises the delicate question: How comfortable are we
with the assumption that ηt and νt are normally distributed? Unless there is a com-
pelling economic reason for assuming normality, we have to regard (as Porter does)
any inference about regime shifts as potentially hinging critically on this maintained
assumption. Fortunately, in Porter’s case he does have some regime classification data
from Ulen (1978) that agrees with his model’s classification of regimes.
At this point it is useful to recall our notion of structure in a simultaneous equa-
tions model. As discussed in Section 3, the most that can be identified from descriptive
analysis is the conditional density of the endogenous variables, yt = (lnpt,lnQ
t),
given the vector of exogenous variables, xt = (1,W
t ,Z
t); that is, f(yt | xt). Accord-
ing to Porter’s theoretical model, this observed conditional density is the result of the
interaction of industry demand and an industry ‘supply’ that switches between collusive
and noncooperative regimes. However, no amount of data will allow the researcher to
distinguish between this regime-switching structural model and a conventional linear
simultaneous equations model with no regime switching.
To derive the likelihood function for the case of a single regime linear simultaneous
equation model, consider the error vector in Equation (45). The first error is by as-
sumption a mean-zero normal random variable and the second is the sum of a centered
Bernoulli random variable, It − τ and a mean zero normal random variable. Applying
the law of total probability formula yields the following density for Et

Both models give rise to the same conditional density f(yt | xt), but have very different
economic implications. The first model implies random switches from competitive to
collusive pricing regimes; the other implies a single-pricing regime but a nonnormal
distribution for Et. Consequently, any test for regime shifts must be conditional on the
assumed supply and demand functions, and more importantly, the assumed distributions
for It and ηt. Because these distributional assumptions are untestable, as this example
illustrates, we believe that any test for stochastic regime shifts, should be interpreted
with caution.
One might view this result as a criticism of structural modeling. To do so would miss
our earlier points about the strengths of a structural model. In particular, a key strength
of a structural model is that it permits other researchers to ask how the modeler’s as-
sumptions may affect results. This example also illustrates our earlier meta-theorem
that: absent assumptions about the economic model generating the observed data, the
researcher can only describe the properties of the joint distribution of xt and yt.
To understand all of the implications of this point, we re-write Porter’s regime switch-
ing model as
(46) y
tΓ = x
tD + ItΔ + U

(47) and Ut ∼ N(0,Σ).
In terms of this notation, the conditional density of yt given xt and It is:

.
Using the assumption that It is an i.i.d. Bernoulli random variable distributed indepen-
dent of Ut and xt yields the following conditional density of yt given xt:
f(yt | xt) = τh(yt | It = 1,xt) + (1 − τ)h(yt | It = 0,xt).
As has been emphasized above and in Section 3, all that can be estimated from a statis-
tical analysis of observations on xt and yt is the true joint density of ftrue(yt,xt), from
which one can derive the conditional density of yt given xt. The fact that ftrue(yt | xt),
the true conditional density, can be factored into the product of two conditional nor-
mal densities times the probability of the associated value of It is due solely to the4324 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
functional form and distributional assumptions underlying Porter’s stochastic economic
model.
Without imposing this economic structure on f(yt | xt), the researcher would be un-
able to estimate underlying economic primitives such as the price elasticity of demand,
the price elasticity of supply, the probability of a collusive versus a competitive regime,
and the magnitude of the difference in prices between the collusive and competitive
regimes. Even the best descriptive analysis would yield little useful economic infor-
mation if the true data-generation process was Porter’s structural model. Suppose that
one had sufficient data to obtain a precise estimate of ftrue(yt,xt) using the techniques
in Silverman (1986). From this estimate, the researcher could compute an estimate of
E(yt | xt) or the conditional density of yt given xt. However, suppose the researcher
computed ∂E(yt|xt)
∂xit
for the ith element of xt. If Porter’s model were correct, this expec-
tation would equal
τ
∂E(yt | It = 1,xt)
∂xit
+ (1 − τ)
∂E(yt | It = 0,xt)
∂xit
,
so that any partial derivative of the conditional mean is an unknown weighted sum of
partial derivatives of the conditionalmeans under the competitiveand collusive regimes.
The researcher would therefore have a difficult time examining the validity of compar-
ative statics predictions concerning signs of these partial derivatives under competition
versus collusion, unless the sign predictions were the same under both regimes. Infer-
ring magnitudes of the competitive or collusive comparative static effects, would be
impossible without additional information.
This last observation raises an important point about the success we would have in
trying to enrich the economic model of regime shifts. Imagine, as some have, that there
are more than two regimes. We might attempt to model this possibility by assuming
that It has multiple points of support. This seemingly more reasonable model imposes
greater demands on the data, as now the extent to which these additional supply regimes
are“identified”isdeterminedbyamorecomplicatednonnormalstructureofthereduced
form errors.
One final point about the estimation of β is that care must be exercised in drawing
inferences about the presence of multiple regimes. Under the null hypothesis that there
are no regime shifts, standard likelihood ratio tests are invalid. The problem that arises
is that under the null of no regime shifts, τ, the probability of the collusive regime, is
equal to zero and β is no longer identified. Technically this causes problems because
the information matrix is singular when τ = 0. It is unclear then what meaning we can
attach to standard tests of the hypothesis that there are distinct regimes.
5.3. Summary
Our analysis of Porter’s model leads us to conclude that demand and supply models for
oligopolistic industries pose special identification and applied econometric problems.
More importantly, the parameters describing competitive conjectures or the degree ofCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4325
competition are not necessarily identified with commonly available data. In general, the
researcher will have to have within-sample variation in demand or cost parameters, or
make specific distributional assumptions and apply specific estimation techniques, to
identify how competitive conduct affects industry supply behavior. As we shall see, this
identification problem is all too common in industrial organization models of firm and
industry behavior.
The strength of Porter’s model is that it both illustrates potential identification and es-
timation problems posed by the standard theory and commonly available industry data.
It also provides a strategy for recovering information about competitive regimes from
limited information about the prevailing competitive regime. Although one could con-
sider alternative strategies for identifying the competitive regimes, Porter compares his
estimates of the probability of collusion to information from Ulen (1978) on when the
cartel was actually effective. This is an example of how other evidence can be brought
to bear to check whether the results of the structural model make sense. Porter finds a
remarkable amount of agreement between the two measures. His model also provides
an economically plausible explanation for the enormous variation in grain prices over
his sample period.
6. Market power models more generally
Porter’s model is an example of an IO model that uses data on market-clearing prices
and outputs to draw inferences about the extent of market competition. Because these
are among the most widely used empirical models in industrial organization, it is worth
goingbeyondPorter’smodeltoconsiderwhatotherstudieshavedonetoidentifymarket
power. There are an enormous number of market power studies, many more than we can
do justice to here. Bresnahan (1989) surveys the early papers in this area. Our focus is
on illustrating the critical modeling issues that arise in the identification and estimation
of these models.
Most empirical researchers in IO define a competitive market outcome as one where
price equals the marginal cost of the highest cost unit supplied to the market. If the
market price is above this marginal cost, then firms are said to exercise “market power”.
While some studies are content simply to estimate price–cost margins, many go fur-
ther and attempt to infer what types of firm behavior (“conduct”) are associated with
prices that exceed marginal costs. A first observation we make below is: absent a struc-
tural model, one cannot infer the extent of competition from the joint distribution of
market-clearing prices and quantities. Put another way, one needs an economic model
to estimate marginal costs (and hence price–cost margins) from the joint distribution of
market-clearingpricesandquantities.Thisstructuralmodelwillinvolvefunctionalform
assumptions and often distributional assumptions that cannot be tested independently of
hypotheses about competition.
While this observation may seem obvious from our discussion of Porter’s model,
there are plenty of examples in the literature where researchers draw unconditional in-4326 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
ferences about the extent of competition. That is, they draw inferences about price–cost
margins without acknowledging that their inferences may depend critically on their eco-
nomic and functional form assumptions.
A second observation below is: while one can estimate price–cost margins using a
structural model, it is problematic to link these margins to more than a few specific
models of firm behavior. In particular, many studies estimate a continuous-valued para-
meter that they claim represents firm “conjectures” about how competitors will react in
equilibrium. Currently there is no satisfactory economic interpretation of this parame-
ter as a measure of firm behavior – save for firms in perfectly competitive, monopoly,
Cournot–Nash and a few other special markets. We therefore see little or no value to
drawing economic inferences about firm conduct from conjectural variation parameter
estimates.
In what follows we discuss these two observations in more detail. We first discuss
how the literature identifies and interprets market power within the confines of static,
homogenous goods models where firms choose quantities. We then discuss at a broader
level what market power models can tell us in differentiated product markets.
6.1. Estimating price–cost margins
Since the late 1970s, many papers in IO have used firm and industry price and quan-
tity data to describe competition in homogeneous product markets. The typical paper
begins, as Porter did, by specifying a demand function and writing down the first-order
condition:
(48) P + θiqi
∂P
∂Q
= MCi(qi).
The goal of these papers is to estimate the ‘conduct’ parameter θi. Most authors assert
that this parameter measures firm “conjectures” about competitor behavior. As such, it
would seem to be a structural parameter that comes from an economic theory. Is this the
case?
Isolating θi in Equation (48), and letting αi denote firm i’s output share and  the
elasticity of demand, we obtain
(49) θi =
P − MCi(qi)
−qi
∂P
∂Q
=
P − MCi(qi)
P

αi
.
From this equation, we see that θi provides essentially the same descriptive information
as Lerner’s (1934) index. That is, it provides an idea of how far a firm’s price is from its
marginal cost. To the extent that price is above marginal cost (i.e., the Lerner index is
positive), IO economists claim that the firm has ‘market power’.
Equation (49) is useful because it identifies two critical structural quantities that a
researcher must have to estimate θi. These are the price elasticity of demand and mar-
ginal cost. Following Porter, a researcher could in principle separately estimate the price
elasticity of demand from price and quantity data. In developing such an estimate, theCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4327
researcher would of course have to worry that the demand function’s form may criti-
cally impact the estimated elasticity. The marginal cost term in Equation (49) poses a
more difficult estimation problem. Equation (49) tells us that with just price and quan-
tity data, we cannot separate the estimation of marginal cost from the estimation of θi.
Even if we have observations on total or even variable cost associated with this level of
output, we are unable to separate them without making specific functional form assump-
tions for demand and marginal cost. Put another way, the identification of θi hinges on
how we choose to estimate marginal cost and the aggregate demand curve. Changing
the marginal cost and demand specification will change our estimate of θi. Unless one
knows the functional form of demand and costs, it is impossible to determine the value
of θi.
Despite the many untestable functional form assumptions necessary to infer marginal
costs from price and quantity data, many studies go further and use Equation (48) to
estimate θi and interpret it as a measure of firm behavior. To understand where this
behavioral interpretation comes from, we return to the economic rationale underlying
Equation (48). In Equation (48), θi is a placeholder for the derivative:
(50) θi =
dQ
dqi
.
According to this definition, θi is not a statement about how far prices are from mar-
ginalcosts,butrathera“variational”conceptassociatedwithfirmbehavior.Specifically,
Equation (48) sometimes is interpreted as saying: the firm “conjectures” industry out-
put will increase by θi should it increase its output by one unit. The problem with this
interpretation is that there are only a few values of θi where economists have a good
explanation for how firms arrived at such a conjecture. This leads to our second obser-
vation above. We know of no satisfactory static model that allows for arbitrary values
of θi. Empirical models that treat θi as a continuous value to be estimated thus are on
shaky economic ground, particularly because these estimates of θi are predicated on a
specific functional form for marginal costs and demand.
To emphasize the danger inherent in associating residually determined θi with behav-
ior, imagine observing two firms producing different quantities who otherwise appear
identical. The conjectural variation approach would explain the difference by saying
firms simply “expect” or “conjecture” that their competitors will react differently to a
change in output. Yet there is no supporting story for how otherwise firms arrived at
these different conjectures. On the other hand, even though the firms appear identical,
one might wonder whether their marginal costs are identical. It seems plausible to us
that unobservable differences in marginal costs, rather than behavior, could explain the
difference in output. Absent a richer model of behavior that explains where conjectures
come from, it is anyone’s guess.
To summarize our discussion so far, we have provided two possible interpretations
of θi. There are, however, a few instances in which θi sensibly corresponds to a spe-
cific market equilibrium. A leading case is price-taking competition, where θi = 0 and
price equals marginal cost. Cournot (θi = 1), Stackleberg and monopoly are three other4328 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
well-known cases. While there has been some debate in the theoretical literature about
whether these models are internally “consistent” static behavioral models [e.g., Lindh
(1992)], each of these models lends itself to a natural interpretation of what θi means
as a conjecture about competitor behavior. Thus, it seems to us sensible to imagine im-
posing these conjectures in the first-order condition (48) and using them to estimate the
parameters of demand and cost functions. One can use nonnested tests, as in Bresnahan
(1987), to determine which of these different models of behavior are most consistent
with the joint density of the data.
Having said this, we realize that some might argue that one loses little by treating
θi as a continuous parameter to be estimated. After estimating it, the argument goes,
one can still compare it to the benchmark values. For example, suppose one precisely
estimated θi = 1.7, and could reject perfect competition and Cournot. One might think
it reasonable to conclude the market is “less competitive than Cournot”. But does this
make much sense? According to the conjectural variations story, and Equation (48), an
estimate of 1.7 implies that firm i believes that if it increases output by one unit, industry
output will increase by 1.7 units. What type of behavior or expectations leads to firm
i maximizing its profits by maintaining θi = 1.7? Why does this value not simply
reflect the extent of misspecification of the demand and cost functions in a Cournot
model? The problem here is that the theory underlying firm i’s behavior (and those of
its competitors’ behavior) is static. There is no obvious explanation for why firm i has
this behavior. Moreover, as we show in the next section, in order to identify an estimate
of θi, a researcher must select a parametric aggregate demand curve and rule out several
types of functional forms for aggregate demand. Otherwise it is impossible to identify
θi from market-clearing price and quantity data.
If there is an answer to the question of where a firm’s conjectures comes from, it must
come from a dynamic model of “conjectures” formation. Riordan (1985) provides one
such model. Given the subtleties involved with reasoning through how today’s com-
petitive interactions might affect future beliefs, it seems unlikely dynamic models will
produce simple parameterizations of conjectures or easily estimated first-order condi-
tions. Moreover, the literature on repeated games has shown that when modeling current
behavior, one has to recognize that threats or promises about future behavior can influ-
ence current behavior. This observation points to a distinction between what firms do in
equilibrium (how they appear to “behave”) and what they conjecture their competitors’
would do in response to a change in each firm’s output.4 This also is a distinction that
Stigler (1964) used to criticize static conjectural variation models.
To understand how this distinction affects empirical modelers, consider a cartel com-
posed of N symmetric firms, each of whom charges the monopoly price. In this case,
one would estimate θi equal to the number of firms. If we gave this estimate a behav-
ioral interpretation, we would report that in this industry, firms conjecture or expect
other firms to change their outputs one-for-one. Yet this may not be the case at all, as
4 Corts (1999) makes a similar argument.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4329
some recent theories have emphasized. The firms may be charging the monopoly price
because they expect that if they defect from the monopoly price by producing a little
more, each of their competitors may punish them by producing much more.
This distinction between the “beliefs” that economic agents hold and what they ul-
timately may do in equilibrium is critical for exactly the reasons we outlined in our
introductory framework. If one wants to describe where price is in relation to a firm’s
marginal cost, then θi provides a descriptive measure of that, but not a statement about
behavior. If, however, one wants to use the estimated parameters to predict what would
happen if the firms’ economic environment changes, then one either must have a theory
in which beliefs and equilibrium behavior coincide, or one must ask which of a small
set of values of θi, corresponding to perfect competition, monopoly, Cournot and the
like, best explains the data.
6.2. Identifying and interpreting price–cost margins
In the previous subsection we emphasized that while one could relate θ to price–cost
margins, one could not separately estimate θ and marginal costs from price and quantity
data alone. Despite occasional claims to the contrary, assumptions about the functional
form of marginal costs are likely to affect estimates of θ and vice versa. This section
illustrates how assumptions about the structure of demand and marginal costs impact
the estimation of the descriptive parameter θ. (Throughout this subsection, we think of
θ as providing descriptive information about price–cost margins.)
The IO literature has adopted different approaches to estimating price–cost margins
depending upon whether or not they have individual firm or industry price and quantity
data. When only industry-level data are available, researchers typically use the equation
(51) P + θQ
∂P
∂Q
= MC(Q)
to estimate a single industry θ. James Rosse’s (1970) paper is the first to estimate the
degree of market power (the price–cost markup), or equivalently a firm’s marginal cost
curve. He used observations on market-clearing prices and quantities from a cross-
section of US monopoly newspaper markets. Rosse’s procedure uses this first-order
condition with θ set equal to 1, along with an assumed parametric aggregate demand
curve to estimate the marginal cost curve. This procedure works for the following rea-
son. Once a parametric functional form for demand is selected, this can be used to
compute ∂P
∂Q for each observation in the sample. Setting the value of θ for each obser-
vation to 1 guarantees that we have the information necessary to compute the left-hand
side of Equation (51) for each observation. This provides an implied value of mar-
ginal cost for every output level in the sample. Combining this data with a parametric
specification for the firm’s marginal cost function, we can estimate marginal cost para-
meters.
To extend Equation (51) to an oligopoly market requires further assumptions. This
equation would appear to mimic a single firm’s first-order condition, and thus we might4330 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
think of it as linked to the price–cost margins of a “representative” firm. But this is
not generally true. Starting as Porter did from the individual firm profit maximization
conditions, we can sum Equation (48) across firms to obtain the relation

which we can rewrite as

Here, θ = 1

Q is an average of firm market shares times the individual firm
θi parameters, and MC(qi) is the average of the N firms’ marginal costs. While this
equation “looks” like the industry aggregate equation (51) used in many studies, it is not
the same without further assumptions. Note, for example, that if θi varies across firms,
then changes in firms’ market shares will generally change θ. Thus, if one is analyzing
time series data on prices and output, it may make little sense to treat θ in Equation (51)
as a constant. An exception is when one assumes all firms have the same θi. But in this
case, one must have the same number of firms in the industry for θ to remain constant
through time.
The assumption that all firms have the same θi amounts to assuming that at the same
productionlevel,allfirms intheindustrywouldhavesimilarlyslopedfirm-leveldemand
curves and the same marginal revenues. This is a nontrivial restriction which would re-
quire justification on a case-by-case basis. A number of studies, beginning with Gollop
and Roberts (1979), Applebaum (1982) and Spiller and Favaro (1984), have argued that
one should relax this restriction by making θ a function of different variables, including
output. To date, however, there is very little economic theory to guide structural models
of how θi varies across firms. The most widely adopted specifications are ad hoc, with
θ depending on firm output, market share or a firm’s size rank.
Another consequence of assuming all firms have the same θ is that differences in
firms’ outputs now are a function solely of differences in marginal costs. In some in-
stances, this leads to a monotonic relationship between the efficiency of a firm and its
observed production. For example, if we assume marginal costs are increasing in output,
then there is an inverse relationship between output and marginal costs. Thus, the firm
with the largest output has the lowest marginal cost, the firm with the second largest out-
put the second lowest marginal cost, and so on. While this relationship may be entirely
reasonable for many industries, it may not be for all.
Turning now to the right-hand side of Equation (51), we see that the notation MC(Q)
gives the impression that only industry output enters the industry supply relation. Put
another way, a reallocation of output from one firm in the industry to another will not
change the right-hand side of the industry supply relation (51). This obviously cannot
generally be true. Equation (53) shows why this is so. To explore this point further, it isCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4331
useful to assume that firms have linear marginal costs of the form
(54) MC(qi) = c0i + c1iqi.
In this case, we can rewrite Equation (53) as
(55) P + θ̃Q

and Cov(x,y) equals the covariance (calculated over firms in the industry) between x
and y. If the ψ term is zero, then Equations (53) and (51) are indistinguishable. This
happens for example when firms have similarly sloped marginal cost functions and the
same θ. In general, however, we can think of Equation (51) as having an error term that
includes ψ. To the extent that ψ is nonzero and varies systematically in the researcher’s
sample,theresearcherwillobtainbiasedestimatesof thedemand,costandθ parameters
by ignoring ψ.
We now turn to considering whether and how functional form assumptions might af-
fect inferences about θ from industry price and quantity data. Both Bresnahan (1982)
and Lau (1982) consider the issue of identification in detail using the aggregate equa-
tion (51). Because their results apply to a special aggregation of individual firm first-
order conditions, it is useful to revisit their discussion in the context of the individual
firm marginal revenue equal to marginal cost conditions. To facilitate this discussion,
let each firm face the demand function Q = D(P,Y,α), where α is a vector of demand
parameters and Y is a set of exogenous variables that shift demand but not cost. Sup-
pose also that each firm has the marginal cost function MCi = c0 +c1qi +c2wi, where
wi is an exogenous cost shifter. If a researcher had time series data on market prices,
firm i’s output, Y and wi over time, the researcher could estimate firm i’s market power
parameter θi using the two equation system
Q = D(P,Y,α),
(59) P = c0 +

c1 +

once some assumption had been made about unobservables. The second equation shows
that by assuming marginal costs are linear in output, we have potentially destroyed the
identification of θi. Consider, for example, what happens when demand has the form4332 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Q = α0 + α1P + α2Y. In this case, firm i’s supply relation is
(60) P = c0 +

c1 +

qi + c2wi.
Hence, even though we can obtain a consistent estimate of the demand parameter α1
from the demand equation, we cannot separate c1 from a constant θi. Of course, if we
are willing to restrict θ, we can identify the marginal cost parameters and price–cost
margins.
It is tempting to identify θi in this case by assuming that marginal costs are constant,
i.e., c1 = 0. Unfortunately, researchers rarely have independent information that would
support this assumption. Alternatively, following Bresnahan (1982), one could identify
θi by allowing the slope of market demand to vary over time in an observable way. For
instance, one might interact price with income (Y) in the demand equation
Q = α0 + α1P + α2YP
to obtain the supply equation
(61) P = c0 +

c1 +

qi + c2wi.
Although θi is formally identified in this specification, its identification in practice de-
pends heavily on having variables, such as income, that interact or otherwise cannot be
separated from price [e.g., Lau (1982)]. In other words, the value of θ is identified off
of a functional form assumption for aggregate demand.
Yet another approach to identifying θi that has not been fully explored is to add
information from other firms’ supply relations. In the language of econometrics, it may
be possible to obtain identification by imposing cross-equation restrictions between the
pricing equations. Returning to the specification in Equation (53), if we added a supply
curve for a second firm j, we still would not be able to identify θi or θj. We would,
however, be able to identify the difference if we assumed that both firms’ marginal
cost functions had the same slope. Alternatively, we could identify the difference in the
slopes of the firms’ marginal cost functions if in a panel data setting (where T goes to
infinity) we assume that all firms have the same constant θ.
Ourdiscussionsofarhassuggestedthatθ isidentifiedbythefunctionalformassump-
tions one makes about market demand and firms’ costs. This dependence seems to not
always be appreciated in the literature, where cost and demand functions are sometimes
written down without much discussion of how their structure might affect estimates
of θ. A useful example of how the functional form of demand affects the identification
of θ is provided by the inverse demand function:
(62) P = α − βQ1/γ
.
This inverse demand function leads to the direct estimator (by applying Equation (49)
above)
(63) θ1 = −γ
P − c
α − P
,Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4333
which illustrates how the demand parameters affect the direct estimate. This inverse
demand function also yields a transformed Equation (51)
(64) Pt =
γct
γ + θ
+
αθ

where the subscript t denotes variables that are naturally thought of as time varying.
Critical to most applications is what one assumes about marginal costs. In the simplest
case,onecanthinkoffirmsashavingconstant,buttime-varyingmarginalcosts ct which
depend linearly on some time-varying exogenous covariates, i.e.,
ct = c0 + Wtω,
where ω is a vector of parameters. Substitution of this relationship into (64) gives the
equation
Pt =

Wtω = β0 + β1Wt.
This equation makes it clear that absent further assumptions, we cannot identify θ from
estimates of β0 and β1 alone. One way around this problem is to recognize from Equa-
tion (53) that θ depends on market shares and the number of firms, both of which are
potentially time varying. This, however, is not the usual approach. Instead, most studies
follow the advice of Bresnahan and Lau and identify θ by assuming that the demand
parameters α and/or γ contain a demand covariate. For example, if we assume that the
inverse demand intercept equals
αt = α0 + Dtα1,
then Equation (64) becomes
Pt =

This equation and the demand equation now exactly identify θ. But note that the es-
timate of θ depends critically on the effect of D on demand and on the curvature of
demand. If we had started out, as many studies do, by assuming linear demand then we
could not estimate θ. This is yet another example of how economic structure is solely
identified by a functional form or distributional assumption.
6.3. Summary
In this section we have discussed how IO researchers use price and quantity data to
estimate price–cost margins. We also have questioned the value of static conjectural
variation parameters. Apart from these observations, we have tried to underscore one
of the key observations of our framework, which is that functional form assumptions
play a critical role in inferences about marginal economic “effects” and the appropriate
model of competition.4334 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
7. Models of differentiated product competition
The previous two sections discussed how IO economists have used price and quantity
data to draw inferences about the behavior of oligopolists selling homogeneous prod-
ucts. These empirical models parallel textbook demand and supply models. The chief
difference is in an oligopoly model, the supply equation is replaced by a price equa-
tion derived from first-order conditions that describe how oligopolists maximize profits.
Because IO economists do not observe the marginal costs that enter these first-order
conditions, they are forced to estimate them along with other structural parameters. It
should not be too surprising that a researcher’s stochastic and functional form assump-
tionshaveacriticalimpactontheresultingestimates,astheresearcherissimultaneously
trying to draw inferences about the nature of demand, costs and competition from just
data on prices and quantities.
This section examines how IO economists have used price and quantity information
on differentiated products to draw inferences about demand, costs and competition. We
first discuss complexities that arise in neoclassical extensions of homogeneous product
models. We then turn to more recent differentiated product discrete choice models.
7.1. Neoclassical demand models
In the late 1980s and 1990s, empirical IO economists began to focus on modeling com-
petition in differentiated product markets such as cars, computers and breakfast cereals.
Bresnahan (1981, 1987) are two early examples of this work. These models also use
price and quantity data to draw inferences about oligopolists’ strategic interactions and
price–costmarkups.Themaindifferencebetweenthesemodelsandhomogeneousprod-
uctmodels is that the researcher specifies separate “demand”and “supply”equationsfor
each product. Thus, instead of working with two-equation, market-level systems such
as (36) and (37), the researcher specifies a J-product demand system:
Qd
1 = h1(P1,P2,...,PJ ,Z1,β1,ν1),
. . .
(65) Qd
J = hJ (P1,P2,...,PJ ,ZJ ,βJ ,νJ )
and a J-equation system of first-order profit maximization conditions:
P1 = g1 Qs
1,Qs
2,...,Qs
J ,W1;θ1,η1 ,
. . .
(66) PJ = gJ Qs
1,Qs
2,...,Qs
J ,WJ ;θJ ,ηJ .
Although these systems look much more complicated than the simultaneous equations
in the homogenous product case, they pose the same basic modeling issue: unless the
researcher is willing to make specific functional form assumptions for firms’ demandsCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4335
and costs, the researcher will be unable to draw inferences about equilibrium firm-level
markups. This issue arises again because, absent economic assumptions about the struc-
ture of demand and costs, the most the researcher can do is use flexible data-smoothing
techniques to recover the conditional joint density of the J prices and J quantities given
the demand and cost variables W and Z. Only by making functional form assumptions
for demand and costs, and assumptions about the forms of strategic interactions, can the
researcher recover information about demand and cost primitives. This means that we
still need specific functional form assumptions to use price and quantity data to draw
inferences about equilibrium markups.
The main new issue posed by differentiated products is one of scale. Now, the re-
searcher has to specify a set of demand functions – potentially involving dozens or
hundreds of products. Left unrestricted, the number of parameters in these demand sys-
tems can easily exceed the number of observations in conventional market-level price
and quantity datasets. This problem has led IO researchers to focus on how best to
formulate parsimonious, yet flexible, demand systems.
To appreciate the practical issues involved, consider the challenge IO economists or
antitrust authorities face in trying to assess the competitiveness of the US ready-to-eat
breakfast cereal industry. Absent cost data, inferences about manufacturer and retailer
price–cost margins have to be drawn from retail prices and sales. As there are over
50 major brands of cereals, a simple model would have at least 100 equations – 50
demand and 50 “supply” equations. Each equation conceivably could contain dozens of
parameters. For instance, paralleling Porter’s homogeneous product specification, we
could assume a log-linear demand system:
lnQ1 = β10 + β11 lny + β12 lnP1 + β13 lnP2 + ··· + β1,51 lnP50 + Z1γ1 + ν1,
lnQ2 = β20 + β21 lny + β22 lnP1 + β23 lnP2 + ··· + β2,51 lnP50 + Z2γ2 + ν2,
. . .
lnQ50 = β50,0 + β50,1 lny + β50,2 lnP1 + β50,3 lnP2 + ···
(67) + β50,50 lnP50 + Z50γ50 + ν50.
This system has over 2600 parameters!5 Such unrestricted parameterizations easily ex-
ceed the number of observations obtainable from public sources.
Even when the researcher has large amounts of data, Equations (65) and (66) pose
significant computational challenges. For instance, to use maximum likelihood, the re-
searcher would have to work with the Jacobian of 100 demand and markup equations.
Nonlinearities in the system also raise the concern that the system may not have a
unique solution or a real-valued solution for all error and parameter values. Although
these complications can sometimes be dealt with in estimation, they may still reappear
when the researcher performs counterfactual calculations. For instance, there may be
5 Recall that aggregate demand need not be symmetric.4336 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
no nonnegative prices or single set of prices that solve (65) and (66) for a particular
counterfactual.
These econometric issues have prompted IO researchers to look for ways to simplify
traditional neoclassical demand models. Many early simplifications relied on ad hoc
parameter restrictions or the aggregation of products.6 For example, to estimate (67) a
researcher might constrain a product’s cross-price elasticities to all be the same for all
products.7 Simplifications such as this, while computationally convenient, can unduly
constrain estimates of price–cost markups.
Multi-level demand specifications provide a somewhat more flexible demand func-
tion parameterization.8 In a multi-level demand specification, the researcher separates
the demand estimation problem into several stages or levels. At the highest level, con-
sumers are viewed as choosing how much of their budget they wish to allocate to a type
of product (e.g., cereal). At the next stage, the consumer decides how much of their bud-
get they will divide among different categories of the product (e.g., categories of cereal
such as kids’, adult and natural cereals). At the final stage, the consumer allocates the
budget for a category among the products in that category (e.g., within kids’ cereals,
spending on Trix, Count Chocula, etc.).
Although multi-stage models also restrict some cross-price elasticities, they permit
flexible cross-price elasticities for products within a particular product category. For
example, a researcher can estimate a flexible neoclassical demand system describing the
demands for kids’ cereal products. Changes in the prices of products in other categories
(e.g., adult cereals) will still affect the demands for kids’ cereals, but only indirectly
through their effect on overall kids’ cereal spending. Exactly how these restrictions
affect estimates of markups is as yet unclear.9
Other recent work in the neoclassical demand system tradition has explored reduc-
ing the number of demand parameters by constraining cross-price effects or making
them depend on estimable functions of covariates.10 Pinkse, Slade and Brett (2002), for
example, constrain the coefficients entering firms’ price elasticities to be functions of
a small set of product attributes. While this strategy facilitates estimation and allows
flexibility in own and cross-price effects, it has the disadvantage of being ad hoc. For
instance, it is not clear where the list of attributes comes from or how the functional
## 6 Bresnahan’s (1989) Section 4 reviews early efforts. Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) provide a survey of
neoclassical demand models.
## 7 One utility-theoretic framework that produces this restriction is to assume that there is a representative
agent with the constant elasticity of substitution utility function used in Dixit and Stiglitz (1977).
## 8 See, for example, Hausman, Leonard and Zona (1994).
## 9 Theoretical work, beginning with Gorman (1959), has explored the restrictions that multi-stage budgeting
models place on consumer preferences, and how these restrictions affect compensated and uncompensated
price effects. See for example Gorman (1970), Blackorby, Primont and Russell (1978) and Hausman, Leonard
and Zona (1994). Nevo (2000) evaluates empirically the flexibility of a multi-stage model.
## 10 An early example is Baker and Bresnahan (1988). They propose a “residual” demand approach which
forsakes identification of the original structural parameters in favor of amalgams of structural parameters.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4337
form of demand reflects the way consumers evaluate product attributes. [Davis (2000)
discusses these and other tradeoffs.]
Besides having to grapple with how best to restrict parameters, each of the above
approaches also has to address the joint determination of prices and quantities. As in
homogeneous product models, the presence of right-hand side endogenous variables
raises delicate identification and estimation issues. Applied researchers can most easily
address identification and estimation issues in demand and mark-up systems that are
linear in the parameters. In nonlinear systems, identification and estimation questions
become much more complicated. For example, the implicit “reduced form” for the non-
linear (65) and (66) system:
Q1 = k1(Z,W,β;θ,ν,η),
. . .
QJ = kJ (Z,W,β;θ,ν,η),
P1 = l1(Z,W,β;θ,ν,η),
. . .
(68) PJ = lJ (Z,W,β;θ,ν,η)
may not be available in closed form. As argued earlier, these equations also need not
have a solution or a unique solution for all values of the right-hand side variables and
errors.
The value of the reduced forms in (68) is that they suggest that there are many poten-
tialinstrumentsforpricesandquantities.Forexample,theysuggestthatonemaybeable
to use other products’ attributes and cost variables as instruments. Unfortunately, most
IO data sets do not have product-specific or firm-specific cost information. Even when
researchers do have cost information, this information is likely to be extremely highly
correlated across products. The lack of good cost covariates has forced researchers to
use the attributes of other products as instruments. These studies have used both the
prices of other products as instruments and the nonprice attributes of other products as
instruments.
Hausman (1997) is a good example of a study that uses the prices of other products
as instruments. Hausman develops and estimates a multi-stage budgeting model for
varieties of breakfast cereals. Because he does not have cost data for the different cereal
products, and he lacks time-varying attribute data, he resorts to using cereal prices in
othermarketsasinstruments.Hejustifiesusingthesepricesasfollows.Hefirstsupposes
that the price for brand j in market m and time period t has the form
(69) lnpjmt = δj lncjt + αjm + νjmt,
where cjt are product-specific costs that do not vary across geographic areas, the αjm
are time-invariant, product-city (m) specific markups, and νjmt are idiosyncratic un-
observed markups. He also assumes that the νjmt are independent across markets. This4338 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
latter assumption allows him to assert that prices in other cities are correlated with a spe-
cific market’s prices and uncorrelated with the unobservable markup or cost component
in prices.
From the perspective of our framework, the essential questions are: What economic
assumptions motivate the pricing equation (69)? Following our homogeneous-product
discussion, the pricing equation (69) could represent either a markup relation obtained
fromafirst-orderprofit-maximizationconditionorareducedformequationarisingfrom
the solution of a model along the lines of (68). To see the problem with the former
interpretation, imagine that each manufacturer j maximizes profits of one product in
each market. Suppose the firm also has constant marginal costs. If it maximizes profits
by choosing quantity, then the markup equations will have the additive form
Pj = cj + τ(Q1,...,QJ ),
whereasin(48)theτ(·)functioncontainsanown-demandderivative.Wecanre-express
this equation as (69)
lnPj = lncj − ln 1 − τ(Q1,...,QJ )/Pj .
The question then is whether the multi-level demand function specification Hausman
uses leads to the second term above having the form αj + νjt, where the ν’s are in-
dependent across markets. In general, his flexible demand system would not appear to
lead to such a specification.
One could imagine alternatively that (69) is the reduced form obtained by simultane-
ously solving the first-order conditions. The problem with this view is that Hausman’s
flexible demand specification implies the costs of all other products should enter the
reduced form. This would mean that either αjm would have to be time-varying to ac-
count for the time variation in other product’s costs or that cjt would have to be market
varying.
In principle, one might imagine adjusting the multi-level demand system or the pric-
ing equation (69) to justify using variables from other markets as instruments. Such
an exercise will require additional economic and statistical assumptions. Consider, for
example, the αjm’s in Equation (69). These terms appear to represent unobserved prod-
uct and market-specific factors that affect markups. They might, for example, capture
San Franciscans’ unobserved health-conscious attitudes. These attitudes might lead San
Franciscans’ to have a higher demand and greater willingness to pay for organic cere-
als. If natural cereal makers are aware of this propensity, they might advertise more in
the San Francisco market. If this advertising is not captured in the demand specification,
then the demand error will be correlated with the α. Hausman recognizes this possibility
by removing the brand-market α’s using product-market fixed effects. Letting  denote
the residual prices from these regressions, his results rely on the adjusted prices:
(70)  lnpjnt =  δj lncjt +  νjnt
as instruments. According to Equation (69), these adjusted prices would only con-
tain adjusted national marginal costs, and residual cost and demand factors affectingCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4339
markups. At this point, Hausman still must assume that: (1) the adjusted time-varying
national marginal costs lncjt are uncorrelated with the demand and cost errors in other
cities; and (2) the residual demand and cost factors affecting markups are independent
of the errors in other cities.
These two assumptions have been vigorously debated by Hausman (1997) and
Bresnahan (1997). Bresnahan (1997) argued that there might be common unobserved
seasonal factors that affect both demand and marginal costs. To illustrate this point,
Bresnahan provides an example in which a periodic national advertising campaigns
translate into increased demands and markups in all markets. This results in correlation
between the idiosyncratic markup terms in other markets and demand errors.11 Whether
these advertising campaigns are of great consequence for demand and price–cost esti-
mates in a particular application is not something that can be decided in the abstract.
Rather it will depend on the marketing setting and the economic behavior of the firms
under study.
Our discussion so far has emphasized the strong assumptions needed to use prices
in other markets as instruments. Do the same arguments apply to nonprice attributes?
At first, it might seem that they might not. Similar concerns, however, can be raised
about nonprice instruments. Consider, for example, the problem of trying to model air-
line travel demand along specific city-pairs. In such a model, the researcher might use
a flight’s departure time as a nonprice attribute that explains demand. The reduced form
expressions in (68) suggest that besides the carrier’s own departure time, measures of
competing carriers’ departure times could serve as instruments. But what makes’ the
characteristics of carriers’ schedules’ valid instruments? They may well not be if the
carriers strategically choose departure times. For example, carriers may space their de-
parture times to soften competition and raise fares.
If firms set nonprice attributes using information unavailable to the researcher, then
we can no longer be certain that product attributes are valid instruments. In some ap-
plications, researchers have defended the use of nonprice attributes with the argument
that they are “predetermined”. Implicit in this defense is the claim that firms find it pro-
hibitively expensive to change nonprice attributes in the short run during which prices
are set. As a result, nonprice product characteristics can reasonably be thought of as
uncorrelated with short-run unobserved demand variables. For example, a researcher
modeling the annual demand for new cars might argue that the size of a car is unlikely
correlated with short-run changes in demand that would affect new car prices. While
this logic has some appeal, it relies on the assumption that unobserved factors affect-
ing manufacturers’ initial choices of characteristics do not persist through time. This is
a question that is not easily resolved in the abstract. For this reason, models that en-
dogenize both price and nonprice attributes continue to be an active area of research
in IO.
## 11 The criticism that advertising influences demand amounts to an attack on demand specifications that ignore
advertising. As Hausman’s empirical model does include a variable measuring whether the product is on
display, the question then becomes whether the display variable captures all common promotional activity.4340 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
7.2. Micro-data models
Our discussion of the product-level demand specifications in (65) has said little about
what it is that leads firms to differentiate products. One ready explanation is that firms
differentiate their products in order to take advantage of heterogeneities in consumer
tastes. For example, car makers regularly alter a car’s styling, size, drive trains and stan-
dard features to attract particular groups of buyers. If IO economists are to understand
how these models are priced and compete, it seems imperative that their demand sys-
tems explicitly recognize how consumer tastes for product attributes will affect demand
at the firm level. In the language of Section 4, it seems critical that firm-level demand
models recognize both observable and unobservable heterogeneities in individual-level
tastes. Most neoclassical demand models, however, are ill-suited to modeling consumer
heterogeneities. This is because it is unwieldy to aggregate most individual-level neo-
classical demand models across consumers to obtain market or firm-level demands.
In the differentiated product literature, researchers have adopted two approaches to
demand aggregation and estimation. One is to estimate individual-level demand func-
tions for a representative sample of consumers. These demand functions are then ex-
plicitly aggregated across the representative sample to obtain market or firm demand.
The second is to instead assume that consumer tastes have a particular distribution in
the population. This distribution, along with individual demands, are estimated together
to obtain estimates of market and firm demand.
In what follows, we explore some of the advantages and disadvantages of these two
approaches. To focus our discussion, we follow recent work in IO that relies on dis-
crete choice demand specifications. These models presume that consumers buy at most
one unit of one product from among J products offered.12 While these unitary demand
models are literally applicable to only a few products, such as new car purchases, they
have been used by IO economists to estimate consumer demands for a range of prod-
ucts.
A key distinguishing feature of these discrete choice demand models is that firms
are uncertain about consumers’ preferences. Firms therefore set prices on the basis of
expected demand. So far, firm expectations have not figured prominently in our discus-
sion of oligopoly models. Thus, we shall begin by showing how this type of uncertainty
enters a structural oligopoly model.
Imagine there are a maximum of Mt customers at time t who might buy a car. Sup-
pose customer i has the conditional indirect utility function for car model j of
Uijt = U(xjt,pjt,ωijt),
where xjt is a K×1 vector of nonprice attributes of car j (such as size and horsepower),
pjt is the car’s price, and ωijt represents consumer-level variables. Consumer i will
## 12 There are continuous choice multi-product demand models. These models are better termed mixed discrete
continuous models because they have to recognize that consumers rarely purchase more than a few of the
many products offered. See, for example, Hanemann (1984).Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4341
buy new car j provided U(xjt,pjt,ωijt) ⩾ maxk=j U(xkt,pkt,ωijt;θ). If firms knew
everything about consumers’ tastes, they would calculate product demand as
(71) Demand for product j =
Mt 
i=1
I(i buys new car j),
where Mt is the number of potential new car buyers at time t and I(Arg) is a zero-one
indicator function that is one when Arg is true. Firms would use this demand function
when it came time to set prices, and the IO researcher therefore would have to do their
best at approximating this sum given the information the researcher has about the Mt
consumers.
Now consider what happens when the car manufacturers do not observe some portion
of ωijt. In this case, if there are no other uncertainties, the researcher would model a
firm’s pricing decision as based on what the firm expects demand to be:
(72)
Expected demand = qe
jt =
Mt 
i=1
E

U(xjt,pjt,ωijt) ⩾ max
k=j
U(xkt,pkt,ωikt;θ)

.
In this expression, E is the firm’s expectation over the unobservables in ωijt. (Here,
the firm is assumed to know the size of the market Mt.) The firm’s expected aggregate
demand for model j can equivalently be expressed as the sum of firms’ probability
assessments that consumers will buy model j:
(73) qe
jt =
Mt 
i=1
Pr(i buys new car j).
This expression shows us how firms’ uncertainties about their environment (i.e., their
uncertainties about consumers tastes) will enter a structural model of competition. In
essence, the IO researcher must now take a stand on firms’ beliefs about consumers –
what they know and do not know – and how this information enters consumers’ tastes.
Once the researcher adopts a specific probability model for consumers’ product
choices, product-level demands simply are sums of consumers’ purchase probabilities.
These purchase probabilities and sums have the potential drawback that they may be
nonlinear functions of consumer taste parameters. Despite this complication, the above
formulation has one important advantage. A discrete choice model allows the researcher
to model consumers’ preferences over a large number of products as a function of a
short list of product attributes (the xjt). Thus, in contrast to the high-dimensionality of
the neoclassical model, here a researcher may be able to reduce the consumers’ choice
problem to a choice over a few attributes.
Two crucial questions that must be answered when developing a discrete choice
model are: What is it about consumer tastes that firms do not observe? And: What
is a sensible model of firms’ expectations? These are important questions because a re-
searcher’s inferences about price–cost margins may well be sensitive to the specification4342 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
of firms’ uncertainties. In what follows, we use our framework for building structural
modelstoevaluatetwoearlydifferentiatedproductmodels.Bothmodelsestimateprice–
cost margins for new cars sold in the United States. The first, by Goldberg (1995), uses
household-level new-car purchase data to estimate household-level purchase probabili-
ties for different new car models. She assumes that these household-level probabilities
are what firms use to determine aggregate demand. The second approach we consider
is by Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995). They do not have household-level data. In-
stead, they construct their demand system from product-level price and quantity data.
Like Goldberg, they too base their demand estimates on sums of individual purchase
probabilities. Unlike Goldberg, they match the parameters of this sum to realized new
car market shares.
7.2.1. A household-level demand model
Goldberg’s model of prices and quantities in the US new car market follows the logic
of a homogeneous product competition model. Her estimation strategy is divided into
three steps. In the first step, Goldberg estimates household-level demand functions. In
the second, the household-level demand functions are aggregated to form estimates of
firms’ expected demand curves. In the third step, Goldberg uses the estimated expected
demand curves to calculate firms’ first-order conditions under the assumption that new
car manufacturers are Bertrand–Nash competitors. From these first-order conditions,
she can then estimate product-level marginal cost functions and price–cost markups for
each new car model. The main novelty of Goldberg’s paper is that she uses consumer-
level data to estimate firms’ expected new car demands. The supply side of her model,
which develops price–cost markup equations, follows conventional oligopoly models,
but it is computationally more difficult because the demands and derivatives for all the
cars sold by a manufacturer enter the price–cost margin equation for any one new car it
sells.
7.2.2. Goldberg’s economic model
Goldberg’seconomicmodeltreatsconsumersasstaticutilitymaximizers.Shecomputes
firms’ expected demand as above:
(74) qe
jt =
Mt 
i=1
Pr(i buys new car j).
Goldberg of course does not observe firms’ expectations. The initial step of her es-
timation procedure therefore seeks to replace Pr(·) with probability estimates from a
discrete choice model. The validity of this approach hinges both on how close her dis-
crete choice probability model is to firms’ assessments and how accurately she is able
to approximate the sum of probability estimates.
To estimate household probabilities, Goldberg uses data from the US Bureau of La-
bor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES). This survey is a stratified randomCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4343
sample of approximately 4500 to 5000 US households per quarter. By pooling data for
1983 to 1987 Goldberg is able to assemble data on roughly 32,000 households purchase
decisions. In her data she observes the vehicles a household purchases and the transac-
tion price. She augments this consumer-level data with trade information about new and
used car attributes.
A critical component of her expected demand model is the list of attributes that
enter consumers’ utility functions. While the transactions price is clearly a relevant
attribute, economics provides little guidance about what other attributes might enter
consumers’ utilities. Goldberg’s approach is to rely on numerical measures found in
car buyer guides. These measures include: horsepower, fuel economy, size, and dummy
variables describing options.
In estimating the expected demands faced by new car manufacturers, Goldberg re-
lies on the representativeness and accuracy of the Consumer Expenditure Survey. The
assumption that her probability model replicates the firms’ assessments of consumer be-
havior allows her to replace Pr(k buys new car j) in (74) with an econometric estimate,
P̂r(k buys new car j), which is sample household k’s purchase probability. The assump-
tion that the CES sample is representative of the Mt consumers allows her to replace the
sum over consumers in (75) with a weighted sum of the estimated household purchase
probabilities:
(75) Estimated expected demand for product j =
St 
k=1
wktP̂r(k buys new car j),
where the wkt are CES sampling weights for sample household k and St is the number
of sample households in year t.
On the production side, Goldberg assumes that new car manufacturers maximize sta-
tic expected profits by choosing a wholesale price. Unfortunately Goldberg does not
observe manufacturers’ wholesale prices. Instead, she observes the transactions prices
consumers paid dealers. In the US, new car dealers are independent of the manufacturer.
The difference between the retail transaction price and the wholesale price thus reflects
the independent dealer’s markup on the car. The dealer’s incentives are not modeled in
the paper for lack of data. Because Goldberg is modeling manufacturer’s pricing de-
cisions (and not transactions prices), Goldberg assumes that there is an exact relation
between the unobserved wholesale prices and average transactions prices she computes
from the CES. For example, she assumes that the wholesale price of an intermediate-
size car is 75% of an average transaction price she can compute from the CES. While
this assumption facilitates estimation, it is unclear exactly why it is profit-maximizing
for dealers and manufacturers to behave in this way.13
Goldberg models manufacturers’ decisions about wholesale prices as outcomes of
a static Bertrand–Nash pricing game in which manufacturers maximize expected US

is the cross-price elasticity of expected
demand. This equation shows that in order to obtain accurate estimates of the firm’s
price–cost margins, we need to have accurate estimates of the firms’ perceived cross-
price elasticities. Changes in the demand model, say by changing the model of firm
uncertainty about consumer tastes, will likely change the estimated cross-price elastici-
ties, and thus in turn estimates of price–cost markups.
Once Goldberg has estimated her demand model and obtained expressions for the
cross-price elasticities, the only remaining unknowns in the firms’ first-order conditions
are their marginal costs, the cjt. Because Goldberg has one first-order condition for each
product, she can in principle solve the system of equations exactly to obtain estimates
of the cjt and price–cost margins.
7.2.3. The stochastic model
To estimate household purchase probabilities, Goldberg employs a nested logit discrete
choice model. She assumes consumers’ conditional indirect utilities have the additive
form
Uijt = U(xjt,pjt,ω̄ijt) + νijt,
whereω̄ijt areobservablehouseholdandproductcharacteristicsandνijt isageneralized
extreme value error. Goldberg goes on to assume that the indirect utility function is
linear in unknown taste parameters, and that these taste parameters weight household
characteristics, vehicle attributes and interactions of the two. The generalized extreme
## 14 In principle, the firm also might be uncertain about its marginal cost of production. Goldberg can allow
for this possibility only if the cost uncertainty is independent of the demand uncertainty. Otherwise, Goldberg
would have to account for the covariance of demand and costs in (76).Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4345
value error assumption appears to be made because it results in simple expressions for
the firms’ expectations about consumer purchase behavior found in Equation (74).
Thegeneralizedextremevalueerrorresultsinanestedlogitmodel.Goldberg’schoice
of logit nests is consistent with but does not imply a particular sequential model of
household decision making. Specifically, she expresses the probability that household k
buys model j as a product of conditional logit probabilities:
Pr(k buys new car j)
= Pr(k buys a car) × Pr(k buys a new car | k buys a car)
× Pr(k buys new in segment containing j | k buys a new car)
× Pr(k buys new from j’s origin and segment | k buys new
in segment containing j)
(78) × Pr(k buys j | k buys new from j’s origin and segment).
This particular structure parallels a decision tree in which household k first decides
whether to buy a car, then to buy new versus used, then to buy a car in j’s segment (e.g.,
compact versus intermediate size), then whether to buy from j’s manufacturer – foreign
or domestic, and then to buy model j.
Goldberg appears to favor the nested logit model because she is uncomfortable with
the logit model’s independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property. The IIA prop-
erty of the conventional logit model implies that if she added a car to a consumer’s
choice set, it would not impact the relative odds of them buying any two cars already in
the choice set. Thus, the odds of a household buying a Honda Civic relative to a Toyota
Tercel are unaffected by the presence or absence of the Honda Accord. The nested logit
corrects this problem by limiting the IIA property to products within a nest.
In principle, Goldberg could have chosen a different stochastic distribution for con-
sumers’ unobserved tastes, such as the multivariate normal. Goldberg makes it clear that
she prefers generalized extreme value errors because they allow her to use maximum
likelihood methods that directly deliver purchase probability estimates. Specifically,
the nested logit model permits her to compute the right-hand side probabilities in (78)
sequentially using conventional multinomial logit software. Her choice of nesting struc-
ture is importanthere because the IIA property holds at the household level for each new
car within a nest. Changes in the nests could affect her estimates of cross-price elastic-
ities. Unfortunately, economic theory cannot guide Goldberg’s nesting structure. This
ambiguity motivates Goldberg to explore at length whether her results are sensitive to
alternative nesting structures.
While the independence of irrelevant alternatives applies to some household choices,
it does not apply at the market demand level. This is because Goldberg interacts income
and price with household characteristics. By using interactions and aggregating using
household sampling weights, Goldberg insures that her product-level demand functions
do not have the economically unattractive IIA structure.15
15 This can be seen by examining the population odds of buying two different vehicles.4346 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Goldberg makes two other key stochastic assumptions when she estimates her nested
logit model. The first is that new car prices and nonprice attributes are independent of
consumers’ unobserved tastes, the νijt. This is a critical modeling assumption, as it is
possible to imagine cases where it would not hold. Suppose, for instance, that the νijt
includes consumer perceptions about a car’s quality, and that firms know consumers
perceptions. In this case, firms’ pricing decisions will depend on the car’s quality. Be-
cause Goldberg does not observe quality, her econometric specification will attribute the
effects of quality to price and nonprice attributes. This results in the same endogeneity
problem found in neoclassical demand models. To see the parallel, imagine that νijt
consists of a product-time fixed effect (“quality”) and noise. That is, νijt = ξjt + ηijt.
Because ξjt is common to all households and known to the firm, it will appear in the
aggregate demand curve

that the manufacturer uses when choosing wholesale prices to maximize profits. Thus,
wholesalepriceswilldependonunobservedquality.BecauseGoldbergdoesnotobserve
product quality, she needs to devise a strategy for removing any potential correlation
between price and consumers’ unobserved tastes.
Thebestwaytoaccountforthisunobservedheterogeneitywithinanestedlogitmodel
would be to add behavioral equations to the model that would explain how manufac-
turers jointly choose price and quality. Such a formulation unfortunately complicates
estimation considerably. As an alternative, Goldberg could simply assume a distribution
for quality and then integrate quality out of aggregate demand using this assumed dis-
tribution. This strategy is economically unattractive, however, because one would have
to recognize the unknown correlation of prices and qualities when specifying the joint
distribution. What Goldberg does instead is assume that unobserved quality is perfectly
explained by a short list of time-invariant product characteristics, such as the manufac-
turer’s identity (e.g., Toyota), the country of origin (e.g., Japan) and the car’s segment
(e.g., compact). The assumption of time invariance allows her to use fixed effects to
capture these components. The ultimate question with this strategy that cannot be easily
answered is: Do these fixed effects capture all the product-specific unobservables that
might introduce correlation between prices and consumers’ unobserved preferences?
Goldberg provides arguments to suggests that these fixed effects are adequate. In prin-
ciple, if she had a dataset that contained many purchases of each model, she could
include a complete set of model-specific dummy variables, and thereby control for all
unobserved (to the researcher) quality differences across models.
A final stochastic component of the model pertains to manufacturers’ marginal costs.
The system of first-order conditions (77) exactly identifies each product’s marginal
costs. Following Hausman, Leonard and Zona (1994), Goldberg uses these marginal
cost estimates to calculate product price–cost markups, which she finds to be somewhat
on the high end of those reported in other studies.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4347
Goldberg also is interested in assessing how marginal costs are related to vehicle
characteristics and market conditions. To do this, she assumes that the implied marginal
costs which she recovers depend on observable product characteristics and an unobserv-
able according to
cjt = c0 + Zjtα + ujt,
where the Zjt are observable product characteristics and ujt are unobservable factors
affectingcosts.Theerrorinthisrelationaccountsfor thefactthattheestimatedmarginal

7.2.4. Results
If we compare Goldberg’s model to homogeneous product competition and neoclassical
differentiated product models, we see that Goldberg’s competition model is consider-
ably richer. Her demand system (75) admits complicated substitution patterns among
products. These substitution patterns depend on the proximity of products’ attributes.
There are two main costs to this richness. First, she must introduce many functional
form and stochastic assumptions to limit the scale and computational complexity of the
model. As we argued earlier, structural modelers often must introduce assumptions to
obtain results. Without these assumptions and restrictions, it would be impossible for
Goldberg to estimate demand and costs, or evaluate the impact of the voluntary export
restraints. She also might not be able to argue convincingly that her estimates make
sense (e.g., that they imply a pure-strategy equilibrium exists or is unique).
A second cost of the richness of her model is that it becomes difficult for her to sum-
marize exactly how each economic and stochastic assumption impacts her conclusions.
For example, at the household level she maintains IIA within nests. Her utility specifica-
tions and method of aggregation, however, imply that IIA will not hold at the aggregate
level. But just how much flexibility is there to the aggregate demand system and the
cross-price elasticities? Questions about the role of structural assumptions such as this
are very difficult to answer in complex models such as this. For this reason, Goldberg
and other structural modelers must rely on sensitivity analyses to understand how their
conclusions depend on their assumptions. For instance, Goldberg spends considerable
time exploring whether her parameter estimates and implied markups agree with other
industry sources and whether the estimates are sensitive to alternative plausible struc-
tural assumptions.
While structural researchers can in many cases evaluate the sensitivity of their es-
timates to specific modeling assumptions, some aspects of structure are not so easily
evaluated. For example, Goldberg’s model relies on the maintained assumption that
the weighted sum of estimated CES sample purchase probabilities accurately measures
firms’ expectations about product demand. If there is something systematic about firms’
expectations that her household model does not capture, then this will mean she is not
solving the same first-order profit maximization problems that the firms were when4348 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
they set prices. Her reliance on this assumption is nothing new. The correct specifica-
tion of demand is implicit in other papers in this area (e.g., Porter and Hausman). As
we argued earlier in laying out our framework, all structural models base their infer-
ences on functional form and stochastic assumptions that are in principle untestable.
In this case, Goldberg’s problem is that she does not observe firms’ expectations. Con-
sequently, when she finds that her model under-predicts total new car sales, she cannot

with her econometric specification or data.16
7.3. A product-level demand model
Bresnahan (1981, 1987) was the first IO economist to use the discrete-choice demand
model in an oligopoly equilibrium model to estimate the extent of firm market power.
Bresnahan’spreferencesassumethatconsumerstradeoffthepriceoftheproductagainst
a single unobserved quality index. Berry (1994) and Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995)
(BLP) extended Bresnahan’s single-index model to allow products to be horizontally
differentiated. In what follows, we describe BLP’s (1995) original model and compare
it to Goldberg’s model and the neoclassical demand systems discussed earlier. Unlike
Goldberg, Bresnahan and BLP only have access to product-level data. Specifically, they
know a new car model’s: unit sales, list price, and attributes. BLP, for example, have
twenty years of data covering 2217 new car models. Their definition of a new car model
(e.g., Ford Taurus) is rich enough to describe important dimensions along which new
cars differ. Their data, however, do not capture all dimensions, such as difference in
some two-door versus four-door models, and standard versus “loaded” models.
BLP use these product-level price and quantity data to draw inferences about con-
sumer behavior and automobile manufacturers’ margins. Like Goldberg, they base their
demand system on a discrete choice model of consumer choices. At first this may seem
odd – how can they estimate a consumer choice model with aggregate data? The an-
swer lies in the structural assumptions that permit them to relate household decisions to
product-level price and quantity data.
We can informally contrast Goldberg and BLP’s approaches by comparing how they
model the product demands on which firms base their pricing decisions. Recall Gold-
berg computes firms’ expected product demands as follows:
(79) qe
jt =
Mt 
i=1
Pr(i buys new car j) =
Mt 
i=1
Ψ(p0t,...,pJt,x0t,...,xJt,ω̄ijt;θ),
where the Ψ(P,x,ω̄ij;θ) are the nested logit purchase probabilities that depend on
the price, p, and nonprice attributes, x, of all models. Because Goldberg only uses
## 16 Goldberg’s chief hypothesis is that the household CES data under-represent total sales because they do not
include government, business or other institutional sales.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4349
household-level data, there is no guarantee that when she aggregates her probability
estimates to form qe
jt that they will match actual aggregate US sales figures, qjt.
BLP (1995) on the other hand do not have the household-level data required to esti-
mate how household choice probabilities vary with ω̄ijt. Instead, they treat actual sales,
qjt, as though it is a realization from the demand curve that the firm uses to set price.
In essence, they assume qjt = qe
jt. BLP then replace the household-specific probabil-
ities Pr(P,x,ω̄ij;θ) on the right-hand side with unconditional purchase probabilities
Sj(P,x,θ). They do this by assuming a distribution, P(ω̄ijt,γ), for the household
variables that they do not observe. Here γ denotes a set of parameters that indexes the
density. Formally, they compute the unconditional demand functions

the distribution of consumer variables is the same for each of the Mt households in
the market for a new car. To estimate the demand parameter vector θ and distribution
parameter vector γ, BLP match the model’s predicted expected sales qe
jt = MtSj to
observed sales qit. (This is the same as matching expected product shares Sj to realized
product market shares, qit/Mt.) As in Goldberg’s econometric model, the economic
and stochastic assumptions that go into the construction of Pr(·) and Sj have a critical
bearing on the resulting demand and markup estimates.
It is useful to reiterate the differences in data requirements and modeling assumptions
between Goldberg and BLP. BLP fit their model to match aggregate market shares,
where market shares are national sales divided by a hypothesized number of potential
buyers at time t, Mt. Consequently, the reliability of demand estimates obtained will
depend on the quality of the estimates of Mt. This in turn will impact the reliability
of their cost estimates. In contrast, Goldberg fits a household-level model and does not
require market-level data. But as noted earlier, this data set excludes some purchases by
businesses and government agencies that are relevant to firms’ pricing decisions. This
could impact her cost estimates.
7.3.1. The economic model in BLP
BLP’s economic model of automobile sales maintains that manufacturers sell new cars
directly to consumers. Manufacturers do not price discriminate and consumers are as-
sumed to know the prices and attributes of all new cars. There are no intertemporal
considerations for either firms or consumers. In particular, there is no model of how
firms choose product attributes, and consumers do not trade off prices and product at-
tributes today with those in the future.
As before, consumer i’s conditional indirect utility function for new cars has the form
Uijt = U(xjt,pjt,ωijt).4350 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Consumers decide to buy at most one new car per household. There are no corporate,
government or institutional sales. In contrast to Goldberg, BLP do not model the choice
to buy a new versus a used car. Instead, purchases of used vehicles are grouped with
the decision to purchase a hypothetical composite outside good labeled product 0. Con-
sumers demand the outside good if they do not buy a new car. Thus, if J
j=1 qjt is the
observed number of new cars bought in year t, q0t = Mt − J
j=1 qjt is the number
choosing to purchase the outside good.
The firm side of the market in BLP is similarly straightforward. Sellers know the
demand functions calculated above and each others’ constant marginal costs of produc-
tion. Sellers maximize static profit functions by choosing the price of each model they
produce. When choosing price, sellers act as Bertrand–Nash competitors, as in Gold-
berg.
7.3.2. The stochastic model
There are three key sets of unknowns in BLP’s model: the number of consumers in each
year, Mt; the distribution of consumer characteristics Pr(ω;γ); and sellers’ manufac-
turing costs. We consider each in turn.
Not knowing Mt, the overall size of the market, is a potential problem because it
relatesthe choiceprobabilitiesdescribedin Equation(80) tounit sales. BLP couldeither
estimate Mt as part of their econometric model or base estimation on some observable
proxy for Mt. Although the first of these approaches has reportedly been tried, few if
any studies have had much success in estimating the overall size of the market. This
difficulty should not be too surprising because the absence of data on the outside good
means that additional assumptions will have to be introduced to identify the overall size
of the market.
One way to develop intuition for the assumptions needed to estimate Mt in a gen-
eral model is to consider the role Mt plays in a cross-section logit model. Specifically,
suppose that utility consists of an unobserved product attribute ξj and an extreme value
error ηij:
(81) Uij = ξj + ηij.
To obtain the unconditional purchase probabilities Sj(p,x;θ,δ) we integrate out the
consumer-level unobservables
(82) Sj =

F(ξj − ξk + τ)f(τ)dτ,
where F(ξj −ξk +τ) = Pr(ξj −ξk +τ > ηik) and f(·) is the density of η. The integral
in (82) yields the logit probabilities
(83) Sj =

The demand functions are then

or using (83)
(85) lnqj = lnM + ξj − ln
 J 

.
The demand parameters here are θ = (ξ0,ξ1,...,ξJ ,M). As a simple counting exer-
cise, we have J equations in J observed new vehicle quantities, and J + 2 unknowns,
θ = (ξ0,ξ1,...,ξJ ,M). Adding a quantity equation for the unobserved quantity of the
outside good, q0, does not change the difference between unknowns and knowns, but
does allow us to collapse the log-quantity equations to
(86) lnqj − lnq0 = ξj − ξ0.
Since by definition q0 = M − J
j=1 qj, we can rewrite the J equations as
(87) lnqj − ln

M −

j=1

= ξj − ξ0.
In general, we require at least two restrictions on the J +2 unknown demand parameters
(ξ0,ξ1,...,ξJ ,M) to be able to solve these J equations. Since the outside good is not
observed, we can without loss of generality normalize ξ0 to zero. This still leaves us one
normalization short if M is unknown.
In their empirical work, BLP choose to fix M rather than restrict the ξ’s or other
parameters. Specifically, BLP assume that Mt is the total number of US households
in year t. This choice has some potential shortcomings. Not all households can afford
a new car. As in Goldberg, entities other than households purchase new vehicles. In
principle, one could model these discrepancies by assuming that the total number of US
households is a noisy measure of Mt, i.e.,  Mt = Mt + Δt. Substituting  Mt into (87)
with ξ0 = 0 gives
(88) lnqj − ln

= ξ̃j.
If we overestimate the size of the market (i.e.,  Mt > Mt) then the left-hand side is
smaller than it would otherwise be by the same amount for each product. This will
make the average (unobserved) ξj seem lower, or in other words that all new cars that
year are worse than average. In essence, the unobserved product qualities would act as
a residual and capture both true quality differences and measurement error in the size of
the market.
In actual applications, we will never know whether we have over-estimated or under-
estimated Mt. This means that we will not know the direction of any bias in estimated4352 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
product qualities, the ξj’s. While the availability of panel data might allow us to attempt
a random measurement error model for Mt, in practice the nonlinearity of the demand
functions in the measurement error will make it difficult to draw precise conclusions
about how this measurement error impacts demand estimates. Thus, one is left with
either using a proxy for Mt as though it had no error or imposing enough additional
restrictions on the demand model so that Mt can be estimated.
ThesecondsetofunobservablesthatenterBLP’s demandfunctionsarethehousehold
variables, ωijt. Formally, BLP assume household i’s indirect utility for new car j has
the additive two-part structure:
(89)
Uijt = δjt + ωijt
=
  
xjtβ + ξjt +
  
xjtνi + α ln(νiy − pjt) + ηijt .
The δjt includes only product attributes. For BLP it consists of a linear function of
observed (x) and unobserved (ξ) product attributes. The elements of the K × 1 para-
meter vector β are interpreted as population average marginal utilities for the observed
attributes.
The ωijt contain three separate household-level terms. The familiar extreme value
error term ηijt allows for unobserved household-specific tastes for each model in each
year. The K × 1 vector of unobservables νi allows for the possibility that household i’s
marginal utilities for observed attributes differ from the population average marginal
utilities (the β’s). While in principle one might expect that households’ marginal utili-
ties would depend on household income and other demographic characteristics, the lack
of household data forces BLP to assume that the νi’s are independent random variables
that are identically distributed in the population.17 BLP assume these random variables
are normally distributed. In addition, they assume that a household’s unobserved mar-
ginal utility for attribute k is independent of their marginal utility for attribute h. The
unboundedness of the support of the normal distribution implies that some households
will prefer attribute k and some will have an aversion to it. Specifically, the fraction that
dislike attribute k is given by Φ(−βk/σik), where Φ(·) is the standard normal cumula-
tive distribution function and σik is the standard deviation of νik.
The final stochastic component of ω is α ln(νyi −pjt), where α is an unknown coeffi-
cient. We use the notation νyi for income to indicate that, like the unobserved marginal
utilities for the observed attributes, income also is an unobservable. The expression in
the natural logarithm is the (unobserved) income the household has left if it purchases
model j. BLP include ln(νyi − pjt) so that they can interpret Uijt(·) as a conditional
indirect utility function. Once again they need to make some distributional assump-
tion on the unobserved νyi in order to compute expected demand. In their empirical
work BLP assume that the natural logarithm has a lognormal distribution. However, the
lognormal distribution must be truncated to make the expenditure on the outside good
17 BLP and others have explored alternatives to this structure. For example, BLP (2004) allow consumers’
marginal utilities to depend on observable and unobservable household attributes.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4353
positive. That is, they need to guarantee that νyi > pjt for all observed and plausible
counterfactual prices pjt.
A final element of the preference specification is BLP’s treatment of the outside good.
BLP assume that the utility for the outside good has the form:
Ui0t = α lnνiy + σ0νi0 + ηi0t.
Unobserved income enters this utility because it is the amount available to be spent on
the outside good when no new car is purchased. No price enters the conditional indirect
utility for the outside good because p0 has been assumed to equal zero. The parameter
σ0 is new; it represents the standard deviation of the household’s unobserved preference
for the outside good, νi0. In essence, νi0 increases or decreases the unobserved product
qualities, the ξj, for household i by the same amount. By adding the same household-
specific constant to the ξ’s, BLP preserve households’ rankings of all new cars based
on their unobserved qualities, but allow households to disagree on the overall quality of
new cars. To see this, suppose for simplicity that α = 0 and β = νi = 0. Utilities then
are as in Equation (89) except Ui0 = σ0νi0 + ηi0. The logit probabilities of purchase in
(83) now have the household-specific form
(90) Sij =
exp(ξj − σ0νi0)
1 + J
k=1 exp(ξk − σ0νi0)
.
Thus, householdswithlargevaluesofν0i donotthinkthatthequalityof newcars is very
high and consequently are more likely to opt for the outside good. Similarly, holding
the unobserved qualities of new cars fixed (the ξ), increases in σ0 reduce the importance
of the unobserved car model qualities for purchase decisions.
7.4. More on the econometric assumptions
Now that we have provided an overview of BLP’s economic and stochastic assump-
tions, it is useful to revisit some of them to understand further why BLP adopt these
assumptions.
7.4.1. Functional form assumptions for price
A critical component of any choice model is the way in which product prices enter
utility. Consider what would happen, for example, if BLP had entered (as some studies
do) price as an additive function in δjt rather than in ωijt. In a standard logit choice
model, with δjt = g(pjt) + δ̃jt, the demand equations have the form
(91) lnqjt = lnMt + g(pjt) + δ̃jt − ln

1 +

.4354 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
The implied own-price and cross-price elasticities for these demands are:

⎩
∂g(pjt)
∂pjt
pjt(1 − Sjt), k = j,
−
∂g(pjt)
∂pkt
pktSkt, k = j.
These expressions show how the extreme value error assumption and the choice of g(·)
affect the structure of the own-price and cross-price elasticities that enter the price-
markup equations. If price enters logarithmically (e.g., g(pjt) = θ lnpjt), then the
own-price and cross-price elasticities only depend on product market shares. In this
case, an increase in the price of a Jaguar would cause the demand for BMWs and Kias,
which have roughly similar shares, to increase roughly the same amount, even though
BMWs and Kias are hardly substitutes. To some extent, one could consider fixing this
problem by changing the way price enters δjt or by interacting functions of price with
other vehicle attributes. Such an approach, however, ultimately may not capture what
one might expect, which is that products with similar attributes will have higher cross-
price elasticities.
The use of the extreme value error can also have some other unattractive economic
consequences. One consequence of the error’s unbounded support is that with finite
attributes, there always will be someone who will buy a product – no matter how
inferior the car is to other cars. Suppose, for example, that instead of having price
enter logarithmically, the function g(p) is bounded above. In this case, product de-
mands will asymptote to zero instead of intersecting the price axis. This asymptotic
behavior can have an unfortunate impact on global welfare and counterfactual cal-
culations. Petrin (2002), for example, finds that when price is entered linearly that
one can obtain implausibly large estimates of the value of Minivans. Figure 1 illus-
trates this problem for two alternative specifications of g(·) using a standard logit
model for shares. The demand curve labeled A assumes price enters δ as −λp. The
concave demand curve B adopts a logarithmic specification paralleling BLP, g(p) =
λln(100 − p). The constant λ is selected so that each curve predicts roughly the
same demand for a range of prices between 60 and 90. (One might think of this as
approximating a range of data that the researcher would use to estimate λ.) Com-
paring the two demand curves, we can see that there would not be too much of a
difference in the two models’ predicted demands or local consumer surplus calcula-
tions for prices between 60 and 90. But often researchers perform calculations that
rely on the shape of the demand function for all positive prices. A common exam-
ple is determining the welfare gain to consumers from the introduction of a new good
[e.g., Petrin (2002) and Hausman (1997)]. In this case, the properties of the demand
function for the new good from the price where the demand curve intersects the ver-
tical axis to the actual market price determine the benefits consumers derive from the
existence of this good. The difference in this calculation for the two demand curves
would be dramatic. For example, Demand Curve A estimates that there are many
consumers with reservation prices above 100, while Demand Curve B says there are
none.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4355
Figure 1.
7.4.2. Distribution of consumer heterogeneity
In their empirical work, BLP emphasize that they are uncomfortable with the IIA prop-
erty of the standard logit choice model, and for this reason they add unobservable
household-car attribute interactions. To gain some understanding of what these unob-
servables add, consider the following three good market:
• therearetwotypesofcarsavailable:large(LARGE = 2)andsmall(LARGE = 1);
• utilities for the large and small cars equal
Uij = β0 + βLLARGEj + ηij = δj + ηij;
and
• the large car has 15 percent of the market, the small car 5 percent and the outside
good the remaining 80 percent.4356 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
This utility specification perfectly explains the market shares. That is, we can match the
observed market shares to the logit shares exactly:
0.15 = exp(β0 + 2βL)/ 1 + exp(β0 + βL) + exp(β0 + 2βL) ,
(93) 0.05 = exp(β0 + βL)/ 1 + exp(β0 + βL) + exp(β0 + 2βL) .
A solution is: βL = 1.098, and setting β0 = −3.871. Although the deterministic utility
specification predicts consumers prefer larger to smaller cars, the infinite support of the
extreme value error νijt results in some consumers having an idiosyncratic preference
for small cars.
Now consider what happens with these data when we add heterogeneity in con-
sumers’ marginal utilities for size. In lieu of assuming a continuous distribution of
marginal utilities, suppose for simplicity that there are just two types of consumers:
those with a taste βL1 for size and those with a taste βL2 for size. Because we can po-
tentially explain the three market shares with just two parameters, assume β0 = 0. In
addition, to avoid the complication of having to estimate the entire distribution of con-
sumer preferences, suppose we know that 15 percent of consumers are of type 1 and the
remaining 85 percent are type 2.
How does this two-type model explain the market share of the small car? It seems in
principle that the two-type model could fit the market share data in the same way that
the single type model did. Both types of consumers would have positive but different
marginal utilities for vehicle size, and the unbounded support of the extreme value error
would account for why some fraction of each type would buy an otherwise inferior car.
To see whether this is the case, we again match the observed market shares to the logit
shares:
0.15 = 0.15
exp(2βL1)
1 + exp(βL1) + exp(2βL1)
+ 0.85
exp(2βL2)
1 + exp(βL2) + exp(2βL2)
,
(94) 0.05 = 0.15
exp(βL1)
1 + exp(βL1) + exp(2βL1)
+ 0.85
exp(βL2)
1 + exp(βL2) + exp(2βL2)
.
A solution is the type 1 consumers have a negative marginal utility for size
(β2 = −2.829) and the type 2 consumers have a positive marginal utility for size
(β1 = 3.9836). Thus, when consumers’ marginal utilities are unconstrained, the choice
model may explain the purchase of an inferior product by indicating that some con-
sumers have negative marginal utilities for otherwise attractive attributes.
This example gets at the heart of IO economists’ distinction between vertical and
horizontal product differentiation models. In vertical models, consumers share similar
opinions about an attribute, and thus will rank products the same. They may, however,
differ in the strength of their preferences. In multi-attribute models, the relation be-
tween vertical and horizontal product differences and product rankings becomes more
complex. For instance, even though consumers may all have positive marginal utilities
for all attributes, they may rank products differently.
In most applications researchers will have only a few attributes that they can use to
explain why consumers prefer one product over others. When there are many productsCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4357
compared to attributes, a large number of products may appear “dominated” according
to a pure vertical model. For example, the Volkswagen Beetle is a small car, has a small
engine, slightly higher than average fuel economy, etc., and yet at times sold relatively
well in the US. One way BLP’s model could explain the apparent relative success of
the Beetle would be to assign it a high unobserved quality, ξ. Alternatively, as we have
seen above, the introduction of heterogeneous tastes can account for why consumers
might prefer an otherwise “average” or “dominated” product. While the introduction
of consumer heterogeneity can increase the flexibility of a discrete choice model, this
increased flexibility may or may not lead to results that are economically plausible. For
instance, in BLP’s Table IV (p. 876), they report an estimated distribution of marginal
utility for miles per dollar (MP$) across consumers that is normal with mean −0.122
and a standard deviation 1.05. This estimate implies that roughly 54 percent of con-
sumers “dislike” fuel economy, in the sense of having a negative marginal utility of
miles per dollar. For the marginal utility of horsepower divided by weight of the car
(HP/Weight), the estimated distribution of marginal utility is normal with mean 2.883
and standard deviation 4.628. This implies that 27 percent of consumers dislike cars
with higher values of HP/Weight. Using BLP’s assumption that these marginal utilities
are independent implies that 14 percent of consumers prefer cars with lower values of
HP/Weight and higher values of MP$. The plausibility of these estimates of the dis-
tribution customer-level heterogeneity is an open question. However, it is important to
bear in mind that the assumptions BLP make about the functional form of customer’s
demands, the joint distribution of customer marginal utilities and income identify the
joint distribution of marginal utilities that BLP recover. In contrast, one advantage of
Goldberg’s approach which uses household-level data, is that the marginal utilities can
be identified from the household-level purchases probabilities that she estimates.
Because inferences about consumer heterogeneity are conditional on maintained
functional form assumptions, it seems imperative that some effort should go into ex-
ploring the robustness of findings to distributional assumptions. To date, there has been
only a modest amount of effort along these lines [see Ackerberg and Rysman (2005),
Berry (2001), Bajari and Benkard (2001, 2005) and the references therein], and much
more work remains to be done. In their empirical work, BLP appear to prefer the use
of normal distributions because it simplifies computations. However, their computations
appear to be simplified more by their assumption that marginal utilities are independent,
than their assumption of normality.
7.4.3. Unobserved “product quality”
The unobserved car attributes, the ξjt, are critical stochastic components of BLP’s ran-
dom utility model. Although the literature sometimes refers to the ξjt as unobserved
quality, they can be any combination of product-specific unobservables that enter con-
sumers’ utility in the same way. The relevance of the ξjt is perhaps best understood
by returning to the cross-section logit model where δj = ξj and ξ0 = 0. In this case,4358 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
demands have the form

= ξj.
From this equation we see that the ξj act as demand “errors” that insure that the
econometric choice model’s predicted market shares match the observed market shares.
Goldberg accounts for the presence of these ξj through her market segment, country-
of-origin, and brand fixed effects. In BLP’s model it is essential that the predicted and
observed market shares match. This is because BLP’s theoretical model presumes that
(unconditionally) each consumer’s decision can be represented by the same multino-
mial choice probabilities: (S0,S1,...,SJ ). Thus, with a sample size of approximately
100million,thereshouldbenoappreciabledifferencebetweentheirmodel’spredictions
and observed market shares. The only way to guarantee that there will be no difference
is to have a sufficiently rich parameterization of demand. The ξ’s achieve just this.
As errors, the ξ are subject to arbitrary normalizations. To understand better why
normalizations are necessary, let us return to the cross section logit model. Assume that
δj = xjβ + ξj, where xj is a K × 1 vector of product attributes. Now, the J equations
in (87) become
(96) lnqj − ln

M −
J 
j=1


= xjβ + ξj.
Assuming M is known, we have J linear equations in J +K unknowns: (ξ1,...,ξJ ,β).
We therefore require K linearly independent restrictions in order to estimate the mar-
ginal utility parameters uniquely. One choice would be to set K of the ξ’s to zero. BLP
instead opt to place moment restrictions on the distribution of the ξ.18 Although they do
not motivate their restrictions in any detail, the computational rationale for the restric-
tions is readily apparent. Specifically, BLP assume that the ξ are mean independent of
the observed characteristics of new cars: E(ξj | x1,...,xJ ) = 0. This moment condi-
tion is useful because it mimics the usual least squares moment conditions, and thus, if
valid, could be used to estimate the marginal utilities (the β’s) in (96). In least squares,
the population moment conditions are replaced by K sample moment conditions.
While imposing the population moment condition E(ξj | x1,...,xJ ) = 0 has a use-
ful computational rationale, it also has nontrivial economic implications. In particular,
if we view ξ as an unobserved product attribute such as product quality, then we have to
wonder why it would not be correlated with observable attributes. While we can think
of some attributes that might be uncorrelated, such as the number of doors on a car,
18 In principle, BLP also could have considered other restrictions on the distribution of the ξ. For example,
BLP could integrate out the population market share conditions over a distribution for the ξj. Such an ap-
proach is problematic when the ξj are correlated with observables such as price because the supply side of
their model suggests a complex equilibrium relationship between price and the ξj.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4359
if xj were to include the new car’s price, then there would be a clear cause for concern.
The concern is one of unobserved heterogeneity – the firms observe the quality that
consumers assign to cars and use this information to set price. (Intuitively, firms will set
higher prices for cars with higher quality.)
BLP explicitly recognize this problem and do not include price in the list of con-
ditioning variables x1,...,xJ . This means that they must introduce at least one other
moment condition to estimate the price coefficient. As in the Marshallian demand case,
BLP in principle have many candidate variables they can use to form moment condi-
tions, including the attributes of other vehicles. These other attributes effectively act as
“instruments” for price and any other endogenous attributes.19
Another question that arises in this type of study is: What guarantees that nonprice
attributes are valid as instruments? This is the same issue that arose in our discussion of
neoclassical demand systems. One might well imagine that car manufacturers choose
attributes, such as air conditioning and size, in concert with a new car’s quality (or
other unobservable characteristics). If this is the case, then these attributes are no longer
valid instruments. To obtain valid instruments, we would presumably need to model the
determinants of product attributes.
In their empirical work, BLP base estimation on sample momentconditions involving
the demand and marginal cost errors (discussed below). As can be seen from the market
share expressions in Equation (80), in general it is not possible to compute closed form
expressions for the δjt and ξjt that enter the population moment conditions. This means
in practice that the researcher must numerically invert Equation (80) or use a fixed point
algorithm to solve for the ξjt. While the integral in (80) is straightforward conceptually,
it is difficult to compute in practice. As an alternative, BLP use Monte Carlo simulation
methods to approximate the right-hand side integral. Specifically, they use importance
sampling methods to estimate the integral in (80). They then recover the δjt using a
fixed-point algorithm. From estimates of the δjt, the ξjt can be recovered from the
residuals of an instrumental variable regression of δjt on product attributes.
7.4.4. Cost function specifications
To this point, we have said little about the cost side. In principle, one could estimate
the demand parameters without using information from the supply side. BLP appear to
add the supply side for at least two reasons. First, it contributes variables that can be
used in the orthogonality conditions that identify the demand parameters. Specifically,
their cost-side model contributes two additional instruments (a time trend and miles
per gallon). Following the approach discussed above for constructing demand error in-
struments, BLP now have 21 (seven instruments times 3) sample moment conditions
19 For example in the cross section logit model we can replace the moment condition E(ξj | pj) = 0 with
E(ξj | xk1) = 0, where xk1 is an exogenous characteristic of car k. This again gives us K moment equations.
The resulting estimator is indirect least squares, in which xk1 serves as an instrument for price.4360 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
for the cost-side error.20 Second, by having a supply side model, they can study how
manufacturers’ marginal costs seem to vary with a model’s attributes.
The stochastic specification of the cost-side is fairly straightforward. Sellers equate
the marginal revenues for each model with the constant marginal costs of producing that
model. The researcher estimates sellers’ marginal revenues by differentiating the market
share functions. As in other oligopoly models, BLP decompose product marginal cost
into an observable and an unobservable component. Specifically, they assume that the
natural logarithm of marginal costs depends linearly on a set of cost variables and an
additive error. This error is also used to form moment conditions under the assumption
that its mean does not depend on new car attributes or cost variables.
7.5. Summary
BLP report estimates for several demand models. They provide elasticity and markup
estimates for different new car models. They argue that these estimates roughly accord
with intuition. They also make a case for their unobserved heterogeneity specification.
Because of the complexity of their model, it is harder for the authors to provide a sense
for how their various maintained assumptions impact their results. For instance, the
markups are predicated on the Bertrand–Nash assumption, the choice of instruments,
the attribute exogeneity restrictions, the stationarity and commonality of unobserved
product attributes. Subsequent work, including work by BLP individually and jointly
has sought to relax some of these restrictions.21 Ongoing work by others is exploring
the consequences of other assumptions in these models, and we leave it to others to
survey this work.22
In concluding this section on differentiated product demand estimation, we want to
come back to some of the themes of our structural estimation framework. Previously we
emphasized that researchers should evaluate structural models in part by how well the
economic and statistical assumptions match the economic environment being studied.
Differentiated product models pose an interesting challenge in this regard, both because
they are difficult to formulate and because data limitations often limit the flexibility that
one can allow in any particular modeling format. At present, there are few standards,
other than crude sanity checks, that researchers can use to compare the wide array of as-
sumptions and estimation procedures in use. For example, to date researchers have used
both neoclassical demand and discrete choice models to estimate price elasticities and
markups for ready-to-eat cereal products. Ready-to-eat cereal products would hardly
seem to fit the single purchase assumption of current discrete choice models. Neoclas-
sical models suffer from their reliance in representative-agent formulations. There also
## 20 Because of near collinearity concerns, they drop two of these moment conditions in estimation. That is,
they base estimation on the 5 times 3 (= 15) demand instruments plus 2 times 3 (= 6) cost instruments less
two demand-side instruments.
## 21 For example, Berry (2001) and Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (2004).

have been few attempts to date made to investigate the finite sample or asymptotic per-
formance of different estimation procedures.23
8. Games with incomplete information: Auctions
Over the last thirty years, economic theorists have explored a variety of game-theoretic
models in which private or asymmetric information impacts economic behavior. Ex-
amples include adverse selection, contracting and auction models. In these models,
agents have private information about their “type” (e.g., productivity, health status, or
valuation) and general information about the joint distribution of other agents’ types.
Agents may also face general uncertainty about their market environment (e.g., uncer-
tainty over prices or aggregate productivity). Within this environment, agents use their
private information strategically. The econometrician typically does not know agents’
private information, market uncertainties, or the distribution of agents’ private infor-
mation. Thus, structural models of privately-informed decisions must take into account
not only unobserved private information, but also how agents’ actions are influenced by
private information.
Our goal here is to illustrate how the framework in Section 4 can be used to compare
different econometric models of privately informed agents. Much of this discussion
focuses on auction models. Auctions have recently received enormous attention in IO,
and continue to serve as a proving ground for empirical models of privately informed
agents. We next discuss empirical models of regulated firms’ decisions and regulator
behavior. These models share similarities with auction models, but also pose special
modeling issues.
8.1. Auctions overview
Our discussion of inter-firm competition models emphasized that it is economic the-
ory that allows one to move from estimates of the conditional joint density of prices
and quantities, f(P,Q | X,Z), to statements about firms’ demands, firms’ costs and
competition. This same principle applies to models with privately informed agents – ab-
sent economic assumptions, nothing can be said about agents’ behavior or their private
information.
In auction studies, economists usually know:
1. each auction’s format;
2. the winning bid, and possibly all bids: B = (b1,b2,...,bN);
## 23 Indeed, with panel data on products, where new products are being introduced and old ones abandoned, it
is unclear what would constitute a large sample argument for consistency or efficiency. See, however, Berry,
Linton and Pakes (2004).4362 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
3. item-specific or auction-specific information X (e.g., number of potential bidders,
reservation price, size, quality, date of auction); and
4. bidder-specific information, Z = (z1,z2,...,zN) (e.g., bidders’ identities and
size).
In ideal applications,the economisthas completeinformation on (Bi,Xi,Zi) for a large
number (i = 1,...,I) of related auctions. Thus, the number of bidders and potential
bidders is known; there are no missing bids; and there are no Xi or Zi that the bidders
observe that the econometrician does not. Absent an economic model of the auction,
the best an empiricist can do with these ideal data is recover a consistent estimate of
g(Bi | Zi,Xi) – the conditional density of bids given bidder and auction characteristics.
The conditional density g(Bi | Zi,Xi) is a statistical object. Its dimensionality de-
pends on the number and identity of bidders, and on the variables in Xi and Zi. The
dimension of g(·) is critical because in order to estimate g(·) nonparametrically and
precisely, a researcher will need a large sample of similar auctions. The auctions must
be similar in the sense that they have the same number of bidders and the same X and
Z variables. If this is not the case, then the researcher must divide the sample so as to
estimate a separate nonparametric function for each combination of bidders, and each
set of X and Z variables. For this reason, and because auction data are rarely ideal, em-
piricists typically do not estimate g(Bi | Zi,Xi) nonparametrically. Instead, they use
economic theory to place considerable structure on g(Bi | Zi,Xi).
In what follows we first describe how, with the aid of economic theory, one can re-
cover economic objects from nonparametric estimates of g(Bi | Zi,Xi) (or objects that
can be derived from the density). This discussion illustrates how differing combinations
of economic and statistical assumptions can be used to identify economic constructs.
Becauseinpracticeitmaybedifficultorimpossibletoestimateg(Bi | Zi,Xi)precisely,
we next discuss why one may want to assume a parametric form for g(Bi | Zi,Xi).
We begin our discussion of auction models by observing that there is a strong sim-
ilarity between the first-order conditions estimated in homogeneous-product oligopoly
models (discussed in Sections 5 and 6) and the first-order conditions of auction models.
The two types of models employ substantially different stochastic assumptions how-
ever. In structural oligopoly models, the stochastic structure typically comes from the
first, second and fourth sources of error described in Section 4 – namely, researcher
uncertainty about the economic environment, firm uncertainty about consumers, and
measurement error. By contrast, in most auction models, the stochastic structure rests
exclusively on the second source of model error – “agent uncertainty about the eco-
nomic environment” – and that uncertainty affects strategic interactions. Understanding
the ramifications of these different stochastic specifications is key to understanding how
structural modelers go about recovering agents’ unobserved private information from
data.
In auctions, we shall see it is also important to distinguish between two types of
“agent uncertainty”. One is private information. In this case, bidders know something
that directly affects their probability of winning. The bidders are uncertain, however,
about the other bidders’ private information. The other type of uncertainty is commonCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4363
to all bidders. In this case, bidders do not know the “common” value of the auctioned
item. (They also may have different, privately held opinions about the value of the
item.)
Auction models differ not only in what agents know before they bid, but also accord-
ing to what they assume about whether one bidder’s information is useful to another
bidder. In the simplest models, agents’ private information is independently distributed
and useless to other agents. In more general settings, nonnegative correlations or “af-
filiation” among private valuations may allow bidders to use other bidders’ behavior
to infer something about the unknown value of the item being auctioned. As we shall
see, relationships among bidders’ information can have an important bearing on what a
researcher can recover from auction bids.
8.1.1. Descriptive models
IO economists have devoted substantial attention recently to analyzing auction bid data.
Hendricks and Paarsch (1995), Laffont (1997), and Hendricks and Porter (in press) pro-
vide excellent introductions and surveys of empirical research on auctions. Prior to the
early 1990s, empirical research on auctions largely used regressions and other statistical
techniques to describe how bids, or bid summary statistics, varied with auction-specific
and bidder-specific variables. Of particular interest was the effect that the number of
bidders had on the level and dispersion of bids, as the number of bidders was seen to be
related to the extent of competition.
The results of many of these descriptive studies were difficult to interpret. This was
because it was often unclear how the data or methods in these studies disentangled dif-
ferences in bids due to: observable or unobservable characteristics of bidders; strategic
considerations; or simply differences in bidders’ beliefs about other bidders’ valua-
tions. These problems were perhaps due to the generality in which some auction models
were originally cast. Additionally, these theories were not originally developed to place
testable restrictions on bid distributions. As auction theories were refined and extended
in the late 1970s and 1980s, empiricists began to find the theory more useful for com-
paring bids from different auctions and evaluating bid summary statistics.
Hendricks and Porter (1988) provide a compelling example of how empirical re-
searchers adapted these new auction models to data. Hendricks and Porter used bids
from US government offshore oil and gas lease auctions to study the effect that the
presence of more-informed bidders had on the distribution of bids. In their data, they
identified more-informed bidders as those bidders who owned tracts adjacent to the
auctioned tract. Their logic is that, because geologic formations with oil and gas often
extend over large areas, exploration activities on adjacent tracts are likely to confer an
informational advantage. To develop hypotheses, Hendricks and Porter devised a the-
oretical model of how less-informed bidders will behave in the presence of a single
more-informed bidder. In their model, there is common uncertainty about the future
value of the auctioned tract (say because the future price of oil and the amount of re-
sources in the ground are unknown). Their theoretical model yields an equilibrium in4364 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
which the less-informed bidders use mixed strategies and the more-informed firm uses
a pure strategy. From this model, they are able to derive properties of the distribution of
themaximumbidbyaless-informedbidder.Theycomparethisdistributiontoanexante
distribution of informed bids. The two differ in several ways, including the probability
that there will be no bid or a bid at the reservation price. They also derive results for
the probability that the more-informed bidder will win and the profits of more-informed
and less-informed bidders.
In their empirical work, Hendricks and Porter account for several ways in which lease
auctions differ from the auctions in their theoretical model. First, their model assumes
the presence of one informed bidder, but in their data there can be multiple informed
bidders. Second, their results are cast in terms of the distribution of the maximum bid
by a less-informed bidder. Unfortunately, they do not know the exact structure of this
distribution. These realities lead Hendricks and Porter to estimate a flexible parametric
joint density of the maximum bid submitted by the more-informed (BM) and maximum
bid submitted by the less-informed (BL) bidders. They use these estimated densities to
examine certain predictions of their theoretical model. Mapping what they did to our
notation, Hendricks and Porter cannot estimate and test restrictions on g(Bi | Zi,Xi),
but they can estimate a joint density for two elements of Bi, the maximum bids of the
more-informed, BM, and less-informed, BL, bidders.
Another practical reality is that the government sets reserve prices (or minimum bids)
in these auctions. While Hendricks and Porter argue that the presence of reserve prices
does not affect the equilibrium bid functions, as a practical matter Hendricks and Porter
never observe more-informed and/or less-informed bids below the reserve price. That
is, the reserve prices truncate the conditional density of g(Bi | Zi,Xi). This leads Hen-
dricks and Porter to model the truncated distribution of maximum bids. Specifically,
they assume that absent truncation, the joint distribution of BM and BL follows a bi-
variate lognormal distribution. To handle reserve prices, they work with scaled bids:
(yMk,yLk), where they assume
yik = ln(Bik/Rk) = X
kZ
ik θi + ik,
i = (M,L), Rk is the reserve price for auction k, and (Mk,Lk) are independent and
identically distributed normal random errors. The variables in Xk and Zik contain tract
and sometimes bidder-specific information for each auction.
The presence of the reserve price means that Hendricks and Porter only observe the
yik when they are greater than or equal to zero. This type of truncation can readily be
accounted for in a maximum likelihood setting using tobit-like models. In their empir-
ical work, they develop a likelihood-based model for the scaled bids (yMt,yLt) that
takes into account truncation and correlation in the bid unobservables (Mt,Lt). With
this amended model, they test which elements of X and Z enter the joint density of
(yMt,yLt). They find a variety of results supporting their theoretical model. For in-
stance, conditional on a set of auction-specific observables (X), the participation and
bidding decisions of informed firms are more highly correlated with measures of ex post
tract value.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4365
8.1.2. Structural models
Hendricks and Porter’s paper illustrates many of the important challenges that structural
modelers face in trying to match theoretical auction models to data. Their paper also
illustrates how features of the auction, such as reserve prices, may require the econo-
metrician to make compromises. Before we can begin to evaluate different structural
econometric models of auctions, we first describe the economic objects structural mod-
elers seek to recover from auction data. After describing these economic primitives, we
turn to describing various economic and statistical assumptions that have been used to
recover them.
The primary goal of most structural econometric models of auctions is to recover
estimates of:
1. bidders’ utilities U = (u1,...,uN) (or the joint density fU(U) of these utilities);
and
2. information about the uncertainties bidders face.
In single-unit auctions, bidders are modeled as receiving a nonzero utility from winning
that depends on the price bidder j paid, Pj. Depending on the type of auction being
modeled, bidders’ utilities from winning may also depend on unobservables, such as
the ex post value of the auctioned item. In order to proceed, the researcher thus must
make some assumption about individual risk preferences. Most models assume bid-
ders are risk neutral. In the risk neutral case, bidder j’s utility can then be modeled as
the difference between the ex post value for the object and the price the winner pays:
uj = vj − Pj.
There are several critical things to note about bidders’ utilities. First, it is the price
paidthatenterstheutilityfunction.Dependingontheauctionrules,therecanbeadiffer-
ence between the amount bidder j bids, Bj, and the amount they pay, Pj. For example,
in a second-price (Vickery) purchase auction, the winner pays the second-highest price,
which is less than or equal to what they bid.24 Second, as we mentioned earlier, there
can be a difference in bidder j’s ex ante and ex post private assessment of the value of
the item. When there is no difference between bidder j’s ex ante and ex post private
assessment of the value of the item, we have a private values (PV) model. In this case,
the vj and their joint density, f(v1,...,vN) = f(V), are direct objects of interest.
When there is a difference between bidder j’s ex ante and ex post private assessment
of the value of the item, this is modeled as being due to “common values”, v. These
common values are unobserved by the bidders ex ante, but known ex post. To account
for differences in bids with common values, the bidders are assumed to possess private
information or signals, sj. These signals are assumed generated from a distribution that
is conditioned on the ex post common values v. Thus, in a common values setting, the
## 24 We use the term purchase auction to refer to auctions where higher bids increase the likelihood of winning.
Conversely, procurement auctions are auctions in which lower bids increase the chances of winning.4366 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
economic objects of interest are the signals S = (s1,...,sN), their joint conditional
density f(S | v), the common values v, and the marginal density of the common val-
ues fv(v).
To summarize our discussion of auction models: there are three main dimensions
along which existing auction models differ:
1. Bidders are uncertain about the ex post value of the item.
2. Bidders’ private information signals are correlated.
3. Bidders are symmetric in their uncertainties about other bidders’ private informa-
tion.
In an auction where bidders are symmetric, we can summarize the major types of auc-
tion models and their primitives in a two-by-two table. Table 1 summarizes the two
major differences in the way theorists and empiricists have approached modeling auc-
tion bids. The first row of each cell gives the acronym describing the auction; the second
and third rows give the information and valuation objects, and the related density func-
tions, that a structural modeler seeks to recover.
Our characterization of the affiliated values (AV) model follows Milgrom and Weber
(1982) and McAfee and McMillan (1987). In an AV model, bidders receive private
signals S = (s1,...,sN) about an item’s value and there are also common unknown
components v. Ex ante, each bidder j is uncertain about the value of the item. Bidders’
utilities are (symmetric) functions of the common components v and all bidders’ private
information signals, S. That is, vj = V(sj,Sj,v), where Sj contains all signals but
bidder j’s. In these models, bidders’ private valuations and the common components are
assumed affiliated – which loosely means that if a subset of them are large, it is likely
the remainder are large.25 Because the equilibria of affiliated values (AV) models are
usually very difficult to characterize, there have been few attempts to estimate general
affiliated value models.

IO economists have instead focused on estimating the special cases of the AV model
described in the remaining three cells. The bottom row of the table describes two private
values (PV) models. In a PV model there is no uncertainty to the bidder’s valuation
because bidder j observes sj prior to the auction and thus knows vj. Bidder j still faces
uncertainty in a PV auction, however, because other bidders’ valuations are unknown.
In an asymmetric independent private values (IPV) model, bidders’ presume that the
other bidders’ values are independently drawn from the marginal densities fj(sj). In
an affiliated private values (APV) model, nonnegative correlation is allowed. When the
bidders share the same beliefs about each others’ private valuations, we can represent
the density of valuations in a symmetric APV model by f(s1,...,sN).
Another special case of interest is a pure common values (PCV) model. In contrast
to the private values model, in a PCV model, bidders do not know the value of the item
before they bid. All bidders, however, will ex post value the item the same. Thus, it is
as though there is a single common component v and Vj(S,v) = Vk(S,v) = v for
all signals. Such a situation might characterize a situation where bidders are purchasing
an item for later resale. To calculate the expected value of winning in a PCV auction,
the researcher requires assumptions about the joint distribution of the known signals
and the ex post value. To facilitate calculations, the usual assumptions are that there
is a commonly known prior distribution for v, fv(v) and that bidders’ private infor-
mation conditional on the signal are (symmetrically) conditionally independent – i.e.,
fS|v(S | v) =
!N
j=1 fs|v(sj | v).
We now discuss situations where one can recover the objects listed in this table. The
standard approach to developing a structural auction model is to derive equilibrium
bid functions for each bidder given each bidder’s utility function, the bidder’s private
signal, other bidders’ strategies and the bidder’s beliefs about the other bidders’ signals.
Provided these Bayesian–Nash bid functions are increasing in the unobservable private
information and any common values, the empiricist can potentially recover estimates of
the unobservables. That is (in a slight abuse of notation), the structural modeler hopes
to relate observed data on bids in auction i, Bi, to equilibrium bid function equations:
B1(s1i),...,BN(sNi). While our notation suggests that the equilibrium bid function for
bidder j, Bj(sj) only depends on the bidder’s private information sj, the equilibrium
function also depends on the distribution of private information and common values,
F(S,v). This dependence means that in practice we cannot determine the specific form
of Bj(sj) without either (a) making a parametric assumption about F(S,v), or (b) using
an estimate g(Bi | Zi,Xi) to recover information on the form of F(S,v).
In nearly all empirical auction models, the process of drawing inferences about the
objects in the above table is facilitated by the stark assumption that the only source of
error in auctionbids are S and v. That is, most empiricalmodels of auctions do not allow
for measurement errors in bids or unobserved heterogeneity in the valuation distribution
across auctions.26
## 26 There are exceptions. Paarsch (1992) attempts to model unobserved heterogeneity in timber auctions.
Krasnokutskaya (2002) models unobserved heterogeneity in highway procurement auctions.4368 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
8.1.3. Nonparametric identification and estimation
Recently, structural modelers have devoted substantial energy to the problem of flexibly
estimating the joint density of private information and a single common value com-
ponent – f(S,v). These efforts reflect the practical reality that the researcher rarely
knows ex ante what specific f(S,v) bidders used. While this ignorance might seem to
favor the researcher estimating general nonparametric density functions for affiliated
random variables, such models have proven computationally impractical. This has led
researchers to focus on establishing nonparametric identification and estimation results
for the special cases described in the previous table.
8.1.3.1. Private values auctions Symmetric independent private values auctions
present the simplest identification issues. In a symmetric IPV model, the researcher
seeks to recover an estimate of the marginal density of private information f(sj) (or
equivalently, f(vj)) from bid data. The main result in this literature is that data on win-
ning bids are sufficient to nonparametrically identify f(vj) and estimate vj. To gain
an intuitive understanding of what is involved in deriving nonparametric identification
results for private information models, it is useful to begin by considering what happens
when there is no private information. By ignoring agent uncertainty and agent beliefs,
we can isolate the effect that the econometrician’s uncertainty has on inferences. To do
this, we compare two procurement auctions.
The following example auction draws an analogy between the problem of how to
estimate firm costs in a Bertrand oligopoly setting and the problem of how to estimate
the distribution of private values in an IPV setting.
EXAMPLE 10. In a symmetric IPV procurement auction, the bidders’ valuations (or
in this case costs) are drawn independently from the same marginal distribution f(cj).
Each bidder j only gets to observe their cost cj. Suppose that each bidder can observe
all bidders’ costs, C = (c1,...,cN) so that each bidder knows the identity of the lowest
cost bidder. Because no bidder will find it profitable to bid less than his cost, it is easy
to see that in a Nash equilibrium the lowest-cost bidder will win the auction by bidding
(slightly less than) the second-lowest cost.
This equilibrium is analogous to what would happen in a homogeneous-product
Bertrand oligopoly. In a homogeneous-product Bertrand market where firms have dif-
ferent constant marginal costs, the firm with the lowest marginal cost will end up
supplying the entire market at a price equal to the marginal cost of the second-lowest
cost firm.
Now consider what an economist could learn by observing equilibrium prices
in a set of Bertrand markets. Because the economist knows the equilibrium price
equals the marginal cost of the second-lowest cost competitor, they can use a
random sample of market prices to estimate the density, f(c[2:N] | X,Z), of the
second-lowest marginal cost. Moreover, as we shall see shortly, it will be possi-
ble under certain assumptions for the economist to recover the density of mar-Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4369
ginal costs, f(c | X,Z), from f(c[2:N] | X,Z). Thus, this example suggests how
an economist might recover information about bidders’ valuations in an IPV auc-
tion from only data on winning bids. The key simplifying assumption, which we
shortly relax, is that we assumed that the Bertrand competitors were not privately
informed about their costs. This makes the solution of the Bertrand and IPV auc-
tion very simple in that all but the winning bidder have an incentive to bid their true
costs.
Before introducing private information among bidders, it is useful to explore what
would happen if the economist had more data than just equilibrium price. For ex-
ample, suppose that the Bertrand market followed the format of an English but-
ton auction. In a descending-price English button auction, all bidders start the auc-
tion facing each other with their fingers depressing buttons. The seller then an-
nounces continuously lower prices starting from a very high price. Bidders drop out
of the auction when they remove their fingers from the buttons. The analogy in a
Bertrand market would have prices start out at very high levels with all firms be-
ing willing to supply the market. As firms continuously undercut one another, firms
would drop out once the price fell to their marginal cost. This process would con-
tinue until price hit the marginal cost of the firm with the second-lowest marginal
cost. At this point, the firm with the second-lowest marginal cost would drop out
and the firm with the lowest cost would supply the entire market at this price.
By observing the prices at which all firms dropped out, the economist could di-
rectly infer the marginal costs of all but the most efficient firm. Thus, the economist
could use the drop-out prices to improve their estimates of the density of marginal
costs f(cj).
This next example considers the effect that correlation among private values has
on inferences made from bid data. To do this we compare an APV model to a
homogeneous-product, quantity-setting oligopoly model. Again we assume that the
oligopoly firms’ and bidders’ costs are known. Later we will draw a more formal anal-
ogy between this oligopoly example and a PV auction.
EXAMPLE 11. Consider an N-firm homogeneous product oligopoly in which firms’
constant marginal costs are drawn independently from the joint density
f(c1,c2,...,cN) = f(C). Let P(Q) denote the inverse market demand curve, qi
the output of firm i, and let Q = N
i=1 qi denote industry output. Assume, as in the
previous example, that the suppliers observe C, the vector of marginal costs, before they
choose quantity to maximize profits (given the quantity choices of their competitors).
The profits of each firm are: πi(Q) = (P(Q) − ci)qi. The optimal Nash equilibrium
quantities solve the N first-order conditions:
(97) P = ci −
∂P(Q)
∂Q
qi.
As we shall see shortly, these first-order conditions closely parallel the first-order con-
ditions that determine equilibrium bids in private value auctions.4370 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Using the implicit function theorem, we can solve these equations for quantities as
a function of all firms’ costs. Similarly we can use a change-of-variables formula to
derive the joint density of (q1,q2,...,qN) from the joint density of (c1,c2,...,cN).
Both of these operations require a nonvanishing Jacobian, which amounts to an identi-
fication condition for obtaining the joint density of firms costs, f(c1,c2,...,cN), from
the joint density of (q1,q2,...,qN). Analogously, in an affiliated private values auc-
tion model, there are a set of first-order conditions that relate the privately-observed
costs and assumed joint distribution of costs to the optimal bids. [See, for example, Li,
Perrigne and Vuong (2002).] By observing a large sample of independent and identi-
cal auctions, one could construct an estimate of the joint distribution of the equilibrium
bids, g(B). The researcher could then substitute this estimate into the first-order condi-
tions and (provided certain technical conditions are satisfied) use it to recover estimates
of the unobserved costs.
Although the above discussion is heuristic, it makes clear that identification hinges on
having sufficient similarities in the sampled auctions.27 As soon as the sampled auctions
differ in observableor otherunobservableways, there may be no practicalway by which
the researcher can reliably recover f(c1,c2,...,cN) from the observed bids.
This point is perhaps easier to appreciate by considering how researchers have esti-
mated the distribution of valuations nonparametrically in an IPV setting. Guerre, Per-
rigne and Vuong (2000) were the first to devise techniques for recovering a consistent
estimate of the underlying distribution of IPV model valuations without making specific
parametric assumptions. They model the behavior of N ex ante identical risk neutral
bidders in a first-price auction. In the case of a procurement auction, this amounts to
bidder j maximizing the expected profits

equilibrium bids explicitly to the bidder j’s own cost cj and the distribution function
F(·) of all bidders’ marginal costs. Because by assumption this expression holds for
each of the N bidders across each of the I auctions, the researcher could construct
and compare separate estimates of F(cj) from different random collections of observed
bids.
Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2000, p. 529) describe a related nonparametric pro-
cedure as follows. Assuming no measurement error in the bid data, a straightforward
application of the change-of-variables formula yields an expression for the density of
each bid b:
(101) g(b) =
f(ĉ)
|β(ĉ)|
=
f(β−1(b))
|β(β−1(b))|
where ĉ = β−1(b) is the inverse of the equilibrium bid function, b = β(ĉ), β(·) is
the first derivative of b = β(ĉ), and f(c) is the density associated with F(c). Thus,
ĉj = β−1(bj) is the private cost given the observed bid bj. To apply this formula, they
require that the bid function be strictly monotone.
Equation (101) relates the density of observed bids to the unknown density of private
costs, apart from the derivative of the equilibrium bid function in the denominator. By
differentiating (100) one can obtain an expression for this derivative. Using this expres-
sion to substitute out the integral in (100), we obtain
(102) β(cj | F,n) = cj +
β(cj)[1 − F(cj)]
(N − 1)f(cj)
.
Substituting (101) into this expression and making use of G(bj) = F[β−1(bj)] gives
(103) cj = bj −
1
N − 1
1 − G(bj)
g(bj)
.
Here G(b) is the distribution of bids, g(b) is the density of bids, and N is equal to the
number of bidders. Thus, to recover the unobserved private costs on the left-hand side,
the researcher only requires estimates of the distribution function and density function
of bids. Under the assumption that there are no observable or other unobservable differ-
encesacrossauctions,andthatG(·)andg(·)arethesameacrossauctions,theresearcher
can pool data on all bids to estimate G(·) and g(·) nonparametrically. From (103), the
researcher can estimate cj. Once the researcher has estimates of the cj, nonparametric
smoothing techniques can again be used to produce an estimate of the density f(c) or
distribution F(c) of private costs.
This same strategy can be used to estimate the density of private values nonparamet-
rically if the researcher only observes winning bids. In this case, Equation (101) must
be changed to account for the fact that the winning bid in an IPV procurement auction
is that of the lowest-cost bidder. Because the winning bidder has cost c(1:N), the density4372 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
of the winning bid bw is
(104) h(bw) =
ḡ(β−1(bw))
β(β−1(bw))
, where ḡ(z) = N

and z = c(1:N).
The strength of this nonparametric approach is that it does not require parametric
assumptions about unobserved valuations. To see why this flexibility is important eco-
nomically, it is useful to compare Equation (99)

P = ci −
∂P(Q)
∂Q
qi.
In both equations, the second term on the right-hand side determines the markup over
marginal cost. The numerator of Equation (105) is analogous to qi, the quantity sold.
The denominator is the decrease in the probability of winning the auctioned item with
an increase in the bid, which is analogous to the decrease in quantity with an increase in
price. Just as it was important in oligopoly models to use a demand model that yielded
flexible demand elasticities, so too it is important to have a distribution function F(·)
that yields flexible bid mark-ups.
There are of course costs to estimating G(·) and F(·) flexibly using nonpara-
metric methods. Chief among them is that the researcher will require data on a
large number of similar auctions. In practice the researcher may not be able to
reliably estimate F(·) when there are more than a few dimensions of observable
auction (X) or bidder (Z) heterogeneities. Moreover, reserve prices introduce the
similar truncation issues to those in Hendricks and Porter (1988). Here, trunca-
tion of the density typically will require the use of trimming or other data ad-
justment procedures to obtain an accurate representation of the density close to
reserve prices. Subsequent work has explored some of the issues, but substantial
problems remain in applying nonparametric techniques to standard auction data
sets with differing number of bidders and substantial observed bidder heterogene-
ity.
The structural modeling literature on auctions also has been concerned with the more
general question of whether it is possible to use bid data to discriminate between differ-
ent private information specifications. Given the analysis above, such questions would
seem to be relatively easy to resolve by matching observables to unobservables. For
example, it seems at first glance plausible that a general AV model is unidentified be-
cause one only has N bids from which to infer the N + 1 unobservables – the N costs
c1,c2,...,cN and the general valuation v. Laffont and Vuong (1996) were the first to
consider this question more formally and establish nonparametric identification results.
They showed that for the same number of risk neutral bidders N, that any symmetricCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4373
AV model was observationally equivalent to some symmetric APV model. Moreover,
they showed that while the symmetric APV and IPV models were nonparamertrically
identified, the symmetric common values model was generally unidentified. Athey and
Haile (2002) and others have examined the sensitivity of these results to different mod-
eling assumptions and data sets. In particular, several authors have considered whether
variation in the number of bidders can add additional identifying information.
8.1.3.2. Pure common value auctions In a pure common value auction, each bidder’s
private information, si, is an imperfect signal about the future value of the item. This
additional source of uncertainty introduces another object of estimation – bidders’ prior
distribution on the value of the item, fv(v). To see how inferences are made about this
prior and the density of private information given v, we consider a common values
procurement auction.
In a pure common values procurement auction, all bidders have the same ex post
cost c of performing a task. By assumption, each bidder j has an unbiased cost signal
sj of the cost of the project. This signal has marginal density f(sj | c) and conditional
distribution function F(sj | c). In a PCV model, the bidders’ private information signals
are assumed conditionally independent and all agents are assumed to have the same
prior fc(c) on the cost c.
In a Bayesian–Nash equilibrium, bidder j chooses bj to solve the following expected
profit maximization problem:

The constant k is determined by boundary conditions.
At first it might seem, following our discussion of the IPV model, that a researcher
could use these integral equations as a basis for nonparametric estimation. Closer in-
spection of the differential equation reveals that for a given bid function, βC(sj), there
are a number of distribution functions f(sj | c) and fc(c) that could satisfy the above
differential equation. This is in fact the nonidentification result of Laffont and Vuong
(1996).
8.2. Further issues
These discussions of nonparametric identification show that identification can hinge
delicately on any of several stochastic and economic assumptions. Indeed, there remain
a great many combinations of auction formats and assumptions yet to be explored in
the literature. For example, there are few general results on what can be identified with
risk aversion. What results we do currently have suggest that much stronger identifying
assumptions will be required when bidders are risk averse. [See Campo et al. (2003).]
It also is important to realize that most auction models in the theoretical and empirical
literatures maintain that bidders’ beliefs are symmetric. When bidders’ beliefs differ for
observable and unobservable reasons, auction models become much more challenging –
both because it is more difficult to compute pure-strategy equilibrium bids and because
there may be no pure-strategy equilibrium bids.
There also remain many institutional details that have yet to be fully explored in
the nonparametric identification literature. For example, the presence of reserve prices
can complicate both equilibrium bid functions and nonparametric estimation. These
complications can destroy the identification of part or all of the relevant distributions
of signals and common values. Another important assumption that may not hold in
practice is the assumption that the number of bidders N is exogenous and known by
the researcher. In many auctions, there appear to be few limitations on who can bid.
One reason presumably why we do not see hundreds of bidders is because many are
confident that their probability of winning is sufficiently low that this does not justify
the expense of preparing and submitting a bid. Additionally, potential bidders could be
deterred by the knowledge that other bidders are participating in the auction.
Despite all these limitations, nonparametric identification results and nonparametric
estimation methods provide a useful reference for understanding what can be identified
by imposing minimal economic rationality on observed bids. We now briefly consider
what additional information can be gained by imposing parametric structure.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4375
8.3. Parametric specifications for auction market equilibria
The previous subsection showed how structural econometric modelers have used first-
order conditions from static auction models to estimate the primitives of alternative
auction models. These first-order conditions had the form
(109) bj = βj(vj,N,Fj),
where vj was a private valuation or signal, N is the number of potential or actual bid-
ders,andFj(·)wasajointdistributionofprivateinformationandcommonuncertainties.
From this equation we see that it is both bidder j’s private valuation or signal vj as well
as bidderj’s beliefs about other bidders’ private information and commonuncertainties,
Fj(·), that affect observed bids. Under certain (identification) conditions, the system of
bid functions can be inverted to recover the vj

but only provided the bidder beliefs, Fj, are known or can be consistently estimated.
Because in a typical application Fj is unknown, it seems highly desirable that empiri-
cists be as flexible as possible when estimating Fj. As we indicated repeatedly above,
this desire raises a paradox: the cost of statistical flexibility may be economic flexi-
bility. For example, to even begin to apply nonparametric techniques we must impose
symmetry, Fj = Fk. Further, researchers typically do not have sufficient data to esti-
mate general F’s when N varies considerably across auctions or when there are many
variables that enter the bid function (109). For this reason alone, many researchers have
been willing to entertain parametric specifications for F. There are additional reasons
to favor parametric specifications. One important one is that parametric specifications
can identify economic quantities that are nonparametrically underidentified.
Some empirical researchers feel that as a matter of principle if something is not iden-
tified nonparametrically, one should never make parametric assumptions to identify it.
Other researchers favor such restrictions if they lead to useful parameter estimates or
counterfactuals. We hope it is clear by now that our position is that it is acceptable
to make parametric assumptions as long as these assumptions are economically sensi-
ble and do not contradict the data. To appreciate the trade-offs that can arise in adding
parametric structure, it is useful to see the trade-offs that Paarsch (1997) considered
when developing a structural model of British Columbia government timber auctions.
Paarsch’s goal was to estimate a model of open-outcry timber auction within which he
could ask whether the observed government reserve prices were revenue-maximizing.
This is an ideal setting in which to use a structural model, because Paarsch seeks to
perform counterfactual comparisons.
Several practical realities prevent Paarsch from employing the nonparametric estima-
tion procedures discussed in the previous subsection. First, Paarsch has data on fewer4376 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
than 200 auctions. With less than 200 auctions, he has little hope of obtaining sensible
estimates of a high dimensional conditional bid density. Second, there are at least five
important observable dimensions along which the timber tracts differ. These differences
include: the species composition of the tract, the amount of each species on the tract,
the distance of the tract to local mills, and potential nonlinearities in harvesting costs.
Third, the presence of a reserve price in the timber auctions introduces the same trunca-
tion problems present in Hendricks and Porter’s (1988) descriptive study of offshore oil
and gas lease auctions. Because Paarsch does not observe bids below observed reserve
prices, he cannot estimate F(·) nonparametrically in these regions and thus cannot eval-
uate the revenue consequences of lowering reserve prices. Fourth, although his original
sample consists of open-outcry and sealed-bid auctions, he chooses to focus exclusively
on the open-outcry auctions. In open-outcry auctions, the dynamics of bidding can af-
fect the observed sequence of bids.
Individually and collectively, these practical realities force Paarsch into a parametric
specification of bidders’ valuations and harvesting costs. Moreover, these realities also
appear to force stark assumptions in order to obtain an estimable model. For instance,
while Hendricks and Porter’s discussion of oil and gas leases might suggest timber
auctions have common value components, Paarsch rules out this possibility for at least
two reasons. First, as a practical matter Paarsch’s previous work showed that the private
value auction framework provided as good or better explanation of winning bids as a
pure common value auction framework. Second, English auctions in which bidders have
common values are much more difficult to model. In an open-outcry English auction in
which bidders’ values are affiliated, bidders will revise their beliefs and bids according
to the bidding history – not just their own private signal. For these and perhaps other
reasons, Paarsch is led to adopt an independent private values framework.
In addition to adopting a private values framework, Paarsch also adopts a particular
auction format to model the open-outcry structure of his timber auctions. Specifically,
he assumes bid data are recorded via a “button” English auction. In an English button
auction, all bidders begin the auction in plain view of one another with their fingers on
a button. They listen to the auctioneer continuously call out increasing prices starting
from the reserve price. A bidder exits the bidding (permanently) by removing their
finger from the button. The last bidder depressing the button wins the auction at a price
equal to the second-to-last bidder’s value (or cost).
It is not hard to see why Paarsch makes this assumption. Because bidders’ valuations
are independent and private, bidders do not update their beliefs about valuations dur-
ing the bidding. Moreover, their equilibrium strategy is to stay in the auction until the
bidding reaches their valuation, at which point they drop out. (The winning bidder of
course drops out when the second-to-last bidder does.) How does this equilibrium map
into Equation (109)? Now, for all losing bidders
(110) bj = β(vj,N,Fj) = vj.
Thus, Paarsch’s IPV assumption, when combined with the button English auction as-
sumption, allows Paarsch to recover the valuations of all but the winning bidder fromCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4377
theobservedbids. There is littletodo interms of estimation.Fromanyand allof the los-
ing bids it would be possible to estimate a symmetric distribution of private values F(·)
nonparametrically were it not for the fact that F(·) is conditioned on a large number of
observables that vary across auctions.28
The automatic recovery of values from bids should sound familiar. This was exactly
the solution in Example 10 where we drew a parallel between a perfect-information
Bertrand model and an IPV model in which all bidders knew all costs. Here, Paarsch can
recover exactly the valuation (here, profits) of the second-highest bidder. Paarsch also
observes the third-highest valuation, and so on. Thus, if Paarsch were only interested
in recovering valuations from bids, he could effectively dispense with the private infor-
mation assumption altogether. To perform his reserve price counterfactuals, he could
simply treat F(·) as a statistical construct that captures not private information of the
bidders but simply unobserved (to him) reasons why bidders’ profits would differ across
tracts.
Other aspects of Paarsch’s application have a bearing on how Paarsch estimates and
interpretsF(·) however.Oneoftheseisthematchbetweenthebuttonauctionmodeland
the way the auctions were run and data collected. In a button auction, the last “bid” of a
bidder is the price at which the bidder removes their finger from the button. In an open-
outcry auction, the last observed bid is the last oral bid. For a variety of reasons, bidders
may space their bids in an open out-cry auction, yielding the possibility of nonuniform
jumps in bids. If this is the case, it is unclear how one should interpret the last bids in
Paarsch’s data.
There are other features of the timber auctions that affect the empirical model. To
appreciate these features, it is useful to go into the details of his application. Paarsch de-
composes each bidder j’s valuation vij into an average revenue per tree on the tract, ri,
and average harvesting costs, cij. That is, vij = ri − cij. The absence of a bidder j
subscript on revenues, and the lack of any common value component in the auction,
immediately implies that revenues are known to all bidders. In addition, Paarsch as-
sumes that he observes the revenues bidders observe. He calculates these revenues as a
sum of species prices times the amount of each species the government estimates is on
each tract. Thus, when it comes to distinguishing between private information or unob-
served heterogeneity models, it is the individual differences in harvesting costs that are
important.
A key novelty of Paarsch’s paper is that he models the difference between the poten-
tial number of bidders in an auction and the number who end up bidding. To see why
this distinction is important, notice that the reserve prices in Paarsch’s auctions truncate
not only the distribution of observed bids, but lead to a difference between the potential
number, Ni, and actual number, Ni, of bidders. To model this difference, Paarsch makes
parametric assumptions about the distribution of bidders’ harvesting costs and how they
## 28 There is additional information in the condition that the winning bidder’s valuation exceeds the winning
bid. Paarsch could presumably use this inequality to improve the precision of estimates of F(·).4378 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
vary across auctions. Specifically, he introduces two types of bidder heterogeneity. In
the leading case, he models a bidder’s average cost cij as being drawn from a Weibull
density
cij ∼ F(c | δ) = 1 − exp −δ1(c − cmin)δ2 , c ∈ [cmin,∞],
where the δ’s are unknown parameters that affect the heterogeneity of costs and cmin is
a lower bound equal to
cmin = γ0
1
q
+ γ2q + γ3q2
+ γ4d.
Here, q measures the size of the tract and d is the distance to the closest timber mill.
The δ and γ parameters help capture reasons why the distribution of average harvesting
costs might vary across auctions. Adequately capturing such variation would be crucial
to accurate counterfactual calculations. In a second specification, Paarsch considers the
consequences of assuming fixed harvesting costs, γ0, are random.
By modeling costs parametrically, Paarsch can use maximum likelihood to estimate
the unknown costs of bidders. These costs are critical to his optimal reserve price cal-
culations. One major problem remains however – how to account for the fact that while
he observes the number of bidders, Ni, he does not observe the number of potential
bidders, Ni.
To appreciate this problem, consider timber auctions that have at least 2 bids, i.e.,
Ni ⩾ 2. There will be a difference between Ni and Ni when potential bidders with
extremely high harvesting costs find it unprofitable to bid above the reserve price. The
likelihood of observing the order statistic data c[2:Ni],c[3:Ni],...,c[Ni:Ni] and Ni is

The first portion of this likelihood function (before the ×) is the (binomial) prob-
ability of observing N1 − Ni cost draws below the cost c∗, where c∗ is the cost
that would result in profit of zero at the reserve price. The second portion is
the density of observable average harvesting costs given Ni and that the unob-
served lowest cost satisfies c[1:N] < c[2:N]. The problem with trying to estimate
δ and γ with this likelihood function is that Paarsch cannot compute the likeli-
hood function unless he knows the number of potential bidders Ni for each auc-
tion. Because he does not know Ni, he could treat each Ni as a parameter to be
estimated. This, however, amounts to introducing a new parameter for each auc-
tion. As is recognized in the econometrics literature, the introduction of so many
parameters will make the maximum likelihood estimator inconsistent. Absent a
solution then to this problem, Paarsch, and many later auction researchers, are
stuck.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4379
A main contribution of Paarsch’s paper is to show that a conditional likelihood func-
tion approach [Andersen (1970)] can be used to obtain consistent estimates of δ and γ.
The conditional likelihood approach works as follows. Let f(Ci,Ni | Ni) be the joint
density of observed costs and bidders conditional on the unobserved potential number
of bidders in auction i. According to the conditional maximum likelihood approach, if
this density can be factored into two pieces of the form
f(Ci,Ni | Ni,δ,γ) = g(Ni | Ni,δ,γ) × h(Ci | Ni,δ,γ),
then one can obtain consistent estimates of δ and γ by maximizing the conditional
likelihood function h(Ci | Ni,δ,γ). Paarsch’s contribution is to show that for this
specific IPV auction, the likelihood function (111) has this form, with Ni serving as a
sufficient statistic for the unknown potential number of entrants.
We now are in a positionto return to thepointon whichwe beganthis example.While
the costs of parametric assumptions in many applications are self-evident, the benefits
are sometimes less clear. One important benefit of parametric structure is that it may
allow the researcher to identify a quantity of interest. In Paarsch’s case, the realities of
timber auctions necessitated several strong modeling and parametric assumptions, such
as private values and an English button format. On the other hand, the resulting model
did overcome a significant handicap, which is that the number of potential bidders is
rarely known.
Whether this benefit justifies the starkness of the assumptions, has to be viewed from
at least three vantages. First, is the benefit practically useful? The answer here appears
to be a resounding yes. Without it Paarsch could not estimate his model and perform the
counterfactual optimal reserve price calculations. Second, does the parametric structure
deliver the end result? In Paarsch’s case, the answer is unclear. Finally, does the addi-
tional structure adequately capture the economics of the agents’ behavior, particularly
when it comes to the counterfactuals? To answer this question, Paarsch tries to convince
readers by reporting alternative models and estimates.
8.4. Why estimate a structural auction model?
Previously, we asserted that researchers should not attempt a structural model without
a convincing explanation of how its benefits will outweigh potentially restrictive and
untestable assumptions. This advice seems particularly relevant when considering how
to model auction bid data.
The main benefit of a structural auction model would seem to be that it allows the
researcher to estimate the distribution of bidders’ valuations (or similar objects). Such
estimates can in principle be used to evaluate an auction’s efficiency or how changes in
the rules would affect the seller’s revenues.
In actual applications, however, these benefits are only achieved at the cost of re-
strictions on bidders’ information. In particular, the vast majority of structural auction
models either exclusively estimate independent private values or pure common values
models. The reasons for this specialization are not too hard to find – more realistic4380 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
affiliated models are analytical and computationally intractable.29 Restrictions on the
distribution of bidders’ information naturally limit the applicability of the estimated
model. For example, it makes little sense to estimate an IPV model and then use those
estimates to model what would happen if there was a common value.
Even if we are willing to accept the independent private values or pure common val-
ues assumptions, there are other factors that can affect the value of structural estimates.
Consider what we learn from estimating an IPV model. The best one can hope for is to
be able to recover a precise nonparametric estimate of the distribution of bidder valu-
ations F(vj) above for valuations that would lead to bids above the reserve price. But
what is the value of knowing F(vj)? We believe that the answer is that there is lit-
tle or no value unless we can somehow say that F(vj) is applicable to past auctions
or future auctions. For example, we could imagine estimating F(vj) during a period in
which there was no collusion among bidders and then trying to use the estimated density
to compare bids (valuations) when bidders were perhaps colluding. Alternatively, like
Paarsch (1997), one could perform counterfactuals that involve changing some aspect
of the auction like the reserve price.
The key question is: How does one know that the estimated valuation distribution is
relevant to other auctions? Our position is that to be convincing, the structural modeler
has to have a convincing explanation for when F(vj) is likely or unlikely to change
from auction to auction. To take Paarsch’s (1997) timber auction model as an example,
we might ask: When would his estimates be relevant for a timber auction in another
Canadian province? To answer this question, we ultimately would need to understand
how timber auctions are different. This is not a question that auction theory itself can
answer directly. Instead, the answer likely lies in the specifics of what is being auc-
tioned and how it is auctioned. Thus, we see that economic theory often can only go so
far in answering specification issues. In the end, the econometrician will have to pick
and justify conditioning variables. Ideally, these choices will be made with the aid of
economics, but in practice it is knowledge of the industry, institutions and data that will
likely make the analysis convincing.
Suppose we can accept the assumptions of a structural auction model, what can we do
with the resulting estimates? Structural auction models can in principle facilitate useful
counterfactual experiments. Paarsch’s (1997) evaluation of optimal reserve prices is one
example. Other researchers have used structural models to evaluate alternative winning
bid rules. One area where structural auction models have yet to make much headway is
in diagnosing bidder collusion. Here there are two problems. First, economists do not
have particularly good models of how colluding bidders behave. Indeed, the modeler
often is confronted with the paradox: rationality suggests that colluding bidders will
scramble their bids so as to make detection extremely difficult. To date, most of what
## 29 Although there have been some attempts to compare private values and common values models, these tests
invariably rest heavily on functional form and other assumptions. In the end, little progress has been made
using structural models to decide the appropriateness of different information structures.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4381
structural models have contributed to the detecting collusion literature are benchmark
noncooperative models of bids. IO economists have used these models to look for sus-
pect bid clustering, skewing or correlation.
There are additional practical issues that limit the usefulness of structural auction
models.Onesetpertainstodynamicconsiderations.Inmanyapplications,thedatacome
from repeated auctions where the same bidders bid against one another. This repetition
raises two issues. First, in repeated auctions, bidders’ subsequent valuations may be
influenced by the number of units they have won in the past. In this case, symmetric
information models no longer make sense. Second, in repeated auctions bidders likely
will internalize information and strategic externalities that their bids today may have for
bids tomorrow.
8.5. Extensions of basic auctions models
Recent research has addressed many of the limitations associated with the auction
frameworks described in Table 1. It is well beyond the scope of this chapter to even
begin to survey this literature. Interested readers should consult Hendricks and Porter
(in press).
There are some developments that fit in with our earlier discussions that are worth
noting briefly. Laffont, Ossard and Vuong (1995), for example, extended the IPV par-
adigm to allow for both observable and unobservable heterogeneity across auctions.
Although their estimation procedure assumes a parametric model for the distribution of
private valuations, they devise a clever estimation technique based on simulated nonlin-
ear least-squares that does not require them to compute the equilibrium bid functions.
Instead their technique simulates the expected value of the winning bid for an arbitrary
distribution of private values and a potentially binding reserve price. They also treat the
number of potential bidders as a random variable.
Haile and Tamer (2003) explore the empirical implications of English auctions. The
button English auctions we considered earlier are a special type of English auction. In
open-outcry English auctions, bidders can bid whenever they are willing to best the out-
standing bid (plus any minimum bid increment). Exactly what order and when bidders
will bid is something left to the auction’s format and strategic considerations. In gen-
eral, the dynamics of English auctions are extremely difficult to analyze. Rather than
try and detail the dynamics of the bidding, Haile and Tamer take a minimalist approach
by using potentially weak restrictions on players’ bids. Specifically, Haile and Tamer
maintain that observed bids need only satisfy the following two restrictions: (1) bidders
do not bid more than they are willing to pay; and, (2) bidders do not allow an opponent
to win at a price they are willing to beat. Using these assumptions, they derive bounds
on the distribution of valuations and bids above reserve prices. These bounds become
exact for a button auction and are weak bounds for other English auctions.
There has also been recent empirical research on multi-unit auctions. Virtually all
wholesale electricity markets operating around the world run daily multi-unit auctions
to determine which generation facilities are able to supply energy. Each day suppliers4382 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
submit nondecreasing step functions expressing their willingness each hour to supply
electricity for the next 24 hours. The system operator then computes the least cost way
to meet demand in each hour based on these bids. Wolak (2000) develops a model of
expected profit-maximizing bidding behavior in such markets. Wolak (2003) uses this
model to estimate bidder cost functions. He shows that because of the richness of the bid
functions that market participants submit, the only assumption required to recover these
cost function estimates is expected profit maximizing bidding behavior. An important
difference between these multiple-good auctions and single good auctions is that in
a multi-unit auction, suppliers compete over how many units they sell. Consequently,
residual demand (market demand less the willingness to supply functions of all other
market participants) is observable ex post, and this provides the information necessary
to identify the supplier’s underlying marginal cost function.
As should be clear from this brief discussion, significant progress has been made
in deriving flexible modeling frameworks which allow empirical IO researchers to re-
cover information about the distribution of private information in auction models under
minimal assumptions.
9. Games with incomplete information: Principal-agent contracting models
Recently, IO economists have begun to develop structural econometric models of regu-
lator and regulated firm interactions. These empirical models are more ambitious than
the auction or oligopoly models discussed in the previous sections. Similar to oligopoly
models but unlike auction models, these models seek to estimate production and de-
mand functions. Similar to auction models but unlike most oligopoly models, these
models seek to account for the impact of asymmetric information on agents’ strategic
interactions. These ambitious modeling goals usually require the researcher to rely on
stronger parametric and distributional assumptions to identify and estimate economic
primitives. The main goal of this section is to discuss why models of regulatory interac-
tions require this structure.
As in auctions, private information plays a critical role in regulatory proceedings. IO
economists have recently used principal-agent contracting models to characterize reg-
ulatory proceedings in which regulators set the prices (or “rates”) regulated firms (or
“utilities”) charge. A key insight from these models is that when a utility has superior
information about the underlying economic environment, it can exploit that informa-
tion to earn greater profits than it would if the regulator were equally informed. This
paradigm for studying regulator–utility interactions has received such widespread ac-
ceptance among IO economists that Laffont and Tirole (1993) have coined the phrase
“new regulatory economics”.
One of the most important economic primitives in these contracting models is the
economist’s specification of the regulated firm’s private information. The two main
types of private information a utility can have are private information about its pro-
duction process or its demand. The regulated firm has no incentive to reveal this privateCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4383
information to the regulator because the regulator would use this information against
them in the rate-setting process. The regulator in turn is aware that the firm has private
information, and takes this into account in setting rates. Economic theorists model this
interaction by computing optimal “second-best” solutions to a revelation game. In this
game,theregulatorannouncesapricescheduleandatransferpaymentthatarefunctions
of the firm’s reported private information.
A critical constraint on the firm is that it must serve all demand consistent with the
private information it reports. (Its private information determines the price granted by
the regulator.) Under an optimal “second-best” solution, the price schedule chosen by
the regulator maximizes a social welfare function subject to the constraints that: (1) the
firm finds it profit maximizing to report its true private information to the regulator; and,
(2) the firm expects to earn profits sufficient to keep it from exiting the industry. Al-
though these theoretical models are stylized static depictions of regulatory interactions,
they do capture important features of the asymmetric information problem faced by ac-
tual regulators. Important examples of this work include Baron and Myerson (1982),
Baron and Besanko (1984, 1987), Besanko (1984) and Laffont and Tirole (1986).
Historically, empirical IO economists have largely ignored the impact of regulated
firms’ private information on both regulated firm and regulator behavior. Instead, empir-
ical IO economists have estimated conventional cost and demand functions using stan-
dard cost functions, factor demand equations and product demand models. Christensen
and Greene’s (1976) study of electric utility costs is a classic example of regulated firm
cost function estimation. Evans and Heckman (1984) provide a more recent example of
cost function estimation applied to the AT&T divestiture decision. In virtually all cost
function studies, statistical tests of cost-minimizing behavior are rejected.
The rejection of cost-minimizing behavior is not too surprising if one recognizes the
presence of private information. A regulated firm with private information need not
find it profit-maximizing to minimize costs if it can distort its behavior to obtain better
prices from the regulator. Given these incentives, estimation procedures that assume
cost minimization behavior will yield inconsistent estimates of the underlying economic
primitives.
The remainder of this section follows the format of the previous section. First, we de-
scribe the data a researcher has in a typical application. We then develop a simple model
thatillustrateswhateconomicprimitivescanberecoveredfromthesedata.Afterconsid-
ering nonparametricidentification, we discuss the practical limitations of nonparametric
identification results. This then leads us to describe how parametric assumptions can be
used to identify economic primitives. We illustrate this discussion using Wolak’s 1994
study of Class A California Water Utilities. We close with a short discussion of subse-
quent related empirical work.
9.1. Observables and unobservables
Empirical research on regulated industries benefits from regulatory proceedings that
make rich cost and revenue data publically available. On the cost side, for example,4384 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
regulated utilities typically must report detailed data on inputs, X, and input prices, pX.
Inputs consist of information on the firm’s capital (K), labor (L), energy (E) and ma-
terials (M) choices associated with an observed output Q. Additionally, the researcher
also will have information on input prices, pX = (pK,pL,pE,pM). Using these data,
a researcher can construct an estimate of the total cost, C, of producing the observed
output level Q. In terms of the above notation
(112) C = pKK + pLL + pEE + pMM.
On the output (or revenue) side, firms provide both retrospective and prospective
quantity and revenue data. The prospective quantity data reflect the reality that the regu-
lator must set prices before either it or the firm know what demand will be. When setting
price, the regulator attempts to balance two competing goals: (1) it must allow the firm
to recover all “prudently” incurred costs; and, (2) it must provide strong incentives for
the firm to produce in an efficient manner. To model the prospective nature of the regu-
lator’s pricing decisions, it is imagined that demand equals D(pQ,Z,Q) = Q, where
pQ is an output price set by the regulator, Z is a vector of observable variables assumed
to shift demand and Q is an unobserved demand shifter.
Regulatory models differ according to whether Q is known to the firm (i.e., is pri-
vate information) or is unknown to the firm before the firm reports to the regulator. In
what follows, we only explore models in which the firm has private information about
its production function. Thus, Q here does not reflect private information. The econo-
metrician of course never observes Q.
Given these cost and output data, all an empirical researcher can do is consistently
estimate the joint density of regulated prices, firm outputs, firm input choices, and total
costs – conditional on input prices (pX) and any demand shifters (Z); i.e., the researcher
can estimate h(pQ,Q,X,C | pX,Z). Input prices and the demand observables are
used as conditioning variables because firms are thought to be unable to impact input
prices or factors that influence demand. Thus, these vectors Z and pX are usually as-
sumed to be distributed independently of all of the unobservables in the econometric
model.
To obtain a consistent estimate of the firm’s production process, the researcher must
be very specific about how the utility’s private information interacts with the regulatory
process. In what follows, we explore models in which the regulated firm has private in-
formation about its production process. We restrict our attention to private information
on the production side in keeping with Wolak’s (1994) empirical model. Specifically,
we model the firm’s private information as a single parameter that enters the firm’s
production function Q = f(K,L,E,M,θ). The firm knows θ from the start and all
the regulator knows at the start is the density of θ, fθ(θ), where θ ∈ [θl,θh]. Absent
further assumptions on the distributions of θ and Q, and specific functional forms for
D(pQ,Z,Q) and f(K,L,E,M,θ), little or nothing can be deduced about these un-
derlying economic primitives from h(pQ,Q,X,C | pX,Z). This is because the firm’s
input choices will depend in an unknown way on θ, which implies that total cost, C,Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4385
does as well. Additionally, because the firm must by law satisfy all demand at the reg-
ulated price, the firm’s output will depend on the realization of Q, the unobservable
demand shifter. This implies that the firm’s input choices and total cost will also be a
functions of the realization of Q. Consequently, without functional form restrictions on
the demand and production functions, or assumptions about the forms of the distribu-
tions of θ and Q, the researcher will be unable to identify demand and cost functions
from h(pQ,Q,X,C | pX,Z).
These observations lead us to consider the types of functional form and distributional
assumptions that can lead to identification. We will see that nonparametric identification
of the distribution of private information, as in independent private values auction mod-
els, hinges on a monotonicity condition. We show that strong economic or statistical
assumptions are required to guarantee monotonicity. We then discuss parametric mod-
els. These models rely on functional form and distributional assumptions to identify the
underlying economic and information primitives.
9.2. Economic models of regulator–utility interactions
Baron (1989) provides a useful theoretical model for thinking about empirical models
of regulator and utility interactions. He assumes C(q,θ) = θq+K where θ is the firm’s
private marginal cost of producing output q. No explicit economic rationale is provided
for the cost function. In particular, there is no reason to believe that the firm produces
its output at minimum cost for any value of θ. In this sense, we can think of C(q,θ) as a
behavioral cost function; it gives the cost of producing output q given θ.30 Additionally,
Baron assumes D(p) represents the quantity demanded at the regulated price p. Thus,
in his model there is no demand uncertainty.
In Baron’s model, the regulator fixes a price schedule, p(θ), and a monthly (or an-
nual) fixed fee schedule, T(θ), that give prices and fixed fees as a function of the firm’s
announced marginal cost θ. Given the price and fixed fee schedules, the firm announces
a marginal cost, θ̂, to maximize its profits
(113) π(θ̂;θ) = p(θ̂)D p(θ̂) + T(θ̂) − θD p(θ̂) − K.
There are two constraints imposed on the regulator’s price and fee optimization prob-
lem. The first is a truth-telling or incentive compatibility constraint. This constraint
requires that a firm of type θ will report its true type. In other words, a truthful report
must yield the firm profits that are greater than or equal to profits it could obtain through
any other feasible report in the support of θ. Mathematically, this implies:
(114) π(θ) ≡ π(θ;θ) ⩾ π(θ̂,θ), ∀θ̂ ∈ [θl,θh] and ∀θ ∈ [θl,θh].
## 30 By behavioral cost function we mean only that the firm behaves according to a consistent set of rules that
yield this stable relationship between costs and q for a given value of θ. One possible set of behavioral rules
is to minimize total production costs, but this is not necessary because, as discussed above, the firm may have
little incentive to produce its output according to minimum cost.4386 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
As Baron notes, these constraints are global. That is, they must be satisfied for each θ
and all feasible reports θ̂.
The second constraint is called the participation constraint or individual rationality
constraint. It states that regardless of the firm’s true value of θ, it must receive more
than its outside option. Here this means that the firm must earn nonnegative profits.
Mathematically,
(115) π(θ) ⩾ 0, ∀θ ∈ [θl,θh].
Because it is extremely complicated to impose the global truth-telling constraint on the
regulator’s optimization problem, theorists typically make assumptions about economic
primitives so that satisfaction of local truth-telling implies satisfaction of global truth-
telling. These assumptions are analogous to those in auction models that make the bid
functions monotone in the bidders’ valuations.
Baron (1989, pp. 1366–1367) shows that the local truth-telling constraint for this
problem is the following differential equation in θ:
(116)
dπ(θ)
dθ
= −Cθ D p(θ) ,θ .
This equation tells how profits must increase as a function of θ in order to induce local
truth telling. In words, for small deviations from truthful reporting, the firm experiences
a decline in profits. This condition can easily be checked for the assumed cost function,
as Cθ = q > 0 for all θ.
As Baron notes, Equation (116) can be integrated to produce an expression for the
firm’s profit
(117) π(θ) =
 θh
θ
Cθ D p(x) ,x dx + π(θh).
This equation implies that the participant constraint can be simplified to
(118) π(θh) ⩾ 0,
which means that the least efficient firm, as parameterized by θ, must earn nonnegative
profits. Using the definition of π(θ) in Equation (114), we can re-write Equation (113)
as
(119) π(θ) = p(θ)D p(θ) + T(θ) − θD p(θ) − K.
Deriving the optimal price and fixed fee functions requires specifying the regulator’s
objective function. The general objective function considered for the regulator is a
weighted sum of consumer and producer surplus. Because both consumer and producer
surplus will depend on the firm’s actions, which depend on the unobserved θ, the regu-
lator must use its knowledge of f(θ) to compute an expected surplus function

where α is the relative weight given to the firm’s profits in the regulator’s objective func-
tion. The regulator is assumed to choose the price and fixed fee schedules to maximize
(120) subject to (115), (116), and (119) using calculus of variations techniques.
Baron (1989) shows that the optimal price schedule takes the form
(121) p(θ) = θ + (1 − α)

whichlooksverysimilartoEquation(99)intheindependentprivatevaluesauctioncase,
apart from the parameter α. Baron shows that a sufficient condition for satisfaction of
the local truth-telling constraint to imply satisfaction of the global truth-telling con-
straint is that p(θ) is nondecreasing in θ. This equation shows that monotonicity of the
price function imposes restrictions on the distribution of θ. Specifically, if F(θ)/f(θ)
is nondecreasing in θ, then p(θ) is nondecreasing in θ.
If the value of α is known to the econometrician and firms face the same cost function
and nonstochastic demand function, then it is possible to recover a consistent estimate
of the density of θ, f(θ), from prices. Such an exercise would follow the “change-of-
variables” logic applied to the first-order condition in sealed-bid IPV auction models. It
is important to emphasize all of the assumptions necessary for this identification result.
Besides assuming firms have the same cost function and density of private informa-
tion, we have assumed the demand function is the same across all observations. In other
words, D(p) cannot vary across observations and there are no unobservable Q or ob-
servable demand shifters. Equation (121) also depends crucially on the functional form
of C(q,θ). Without the constant marginal cost assumption, the regulator’s optimal price
schedule will depend on the demand function D(p).31
Although this nonparametric identification result may at first seem appealing, it
should not give much comfort to regulatory economics researchers for three reasons.
First, it is difficult to imagine circumstances where the researcher will know the value
of α. Second, the underlying cost function tells the researcher nothing about the tech-
nology of production. As noted earlier, C(q,θ) simply characterizes the relationship
between production costs, q, and θ. The researcher cannot say anything about the re-
turns to scale in production, the elasticity of substitution between inputs or the extent
to which the regulatory process results in deviations from minimum cost production.
Moreover, the manner in which θ enters the cost function is extremely restrictive.
Third, nonparametric identification rests on unrealistic assumptions about the extent of
observed and unobserved heterogeneity in the production process and demand. Specif-
ically, in this model the only reason market prices differ across observations is because
of different realizations of θ. It is difficult to imagine a sample of regulator–utility in-
teractions with no observed or unobserved heterogeneity in the production and demand
functions.

possible to recover a consistent estimate of K from information on the regulated quantity and total production
cost. Also, if the researcher is willing to assume D(p) is the same for all observations in the sample, then the
set of observed (pQ,Q) pairs will nonparametrically trace out the demand curve D(p).4388 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
Some of these shortcomings can be overcome by explicitly specifying an underlying
productionfunctionand how it depends on θ. The firm’s observed cost functioncan then
be derived from the assumption of expected profit-maximizing behavior subject to the
constraints imposed on firm behavior by the regulatory process. Both observed and un-
observed heterogeneity can also be allowed in the production function and the demand
function facing the regulated firm. However, there is a cost of being more general – non-
parametric identification is lost, just as it is in the case of auction models. As we now
show, however, by clever choices of functional forms and distributional assumptions,
the researcher can estimate a rich set of underlying economic primitives.
9.3. Estimating productions functions accounting for private information
Wolak (1994) derives and implements a procedure to recover a consistent estimate
of a regulated firm’s production technology taking into account the impact of private
information on regulator–utility interactions. As noted above, this task requires the im-
position of parametric and distributional assumptions. These assumptions allow Wolak
to identify the underlying economic primitives from the joint density of the regulated
price, the firm’s output, input choices and total cost, conditional on the vectors of input
prices and demand shifters, h(pQ,Q,X,C | pX,Z). As we have said repeatedly, there
is no single “right” way to make these assumptions. It is presumably economics and the
specific features of a market and regulatory environment that can help the researcher
defend the assumptions necessary to obtain identification.
Wolak models the behavior of a sample of Class A California Water utilities using
annual data on utility outputs, production costs, input quantities and prices, several de-
mand shifters, and output prices. He has panel data from 1980 to 1986. Class A utilities
distribute water and provide services to large cities in California. Consistent with our
earlier discussion, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) sets the retail
price of water for these utilities on a prospective basis.
As Wolak (1994) notes, the water supply industry was chosen, as opposed to other
regulated industries, such as telecommunications, or electricity, for two major reasons.
First, the structure of production in water delivery is extremely simple relative to pro-
ducing electricity or providing telecommunications services. Second, the assumption of
a single homogenous product is likely to be far less objectionable than would be the
case for either telecommunications or electricity. These reasons help Wolak to simplify
his econometric model.
As with any structural econometric modeling exercise, it is important to have a clear
idea of what economic magnitudes can be recovered from a structural model. Wolak
would first like to obtain a consistent estimate of the underlying production function. To
do this, he explicitly models the impact of the utility’s private information on produc-
tion. Instead of estimating the production function directly, Wolak derives the utility’s
cost function under the assumption of expected profit-maximizing behavior. He then es-
timates the production function parameters from the cost function. A useful by-product
of this approach is an estimate of the distribution of private information. A second goalCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4389
of the structural model is to obtain an estimate of how much firm output is distorted
from minimum cost production due to the presence of private information. A third goal
is to test the relative performance of the asymmetric information model versus the con-
ventional symmetric information model of the regulator–utility interaction.
To evaluate the relative performance of the asymmetric information model, the pa-
per posits a second behavioral model of regulator–utility interaction for the same set
of underlying economic primitives. In this model, the utility initially possesses private
information. Through information gathering, however, the regulator is able to com-
pletely learn this parameter. Consequently, the regulator can impose what Wolak calls
the symmetric (or full) information regulatory outcome. Unfortunately, the econome-
trician is unable to observe this private information parameter and so must take it into
account.
Wolak does this when specifying and estimating the behavioral cost functions. The
asymmetric information model assumes that the utility possesses private information,
but the regulator is unable to completely learn this private information through its in-
formation gathering efforts. However, the regulator does learn the distribution of this
private information for each utility, and regulates using this incomplete information op-
timally. The regulator is assumed to impose a version of the asymmetric information
optimal “second-best” regulatory outcome described in the previous section. In this
case, the econometrician also is unable to observe the utility’s private information (or
even its distribution), but must account for this assumed utility–regulator interaction
when estimating the parameters of the utility’s production function.
Wolak assumes the production function for water delivery for utility i is
(122) Qi = f Ki,L∗
i ,Ei,
Q
i | β ,
whereKi denotescapital(physicalplantandwatersources),L∗
i labor,andEi electricity.
The parameter β is a vector describing the technical coefficients of production. It is
known to both the regulator and utility, but is unknown to the econometrician. The
variable 
Q
i is a stochastic disturbance to the ith utility’s production process that is
realized after the utility makes its capital stock selection, but before it produces. The
utility knows the distribution of 
Q
i , which is independently and identically distributed
over time and across utilities. Allowing for this source of unobservable heterogeneity in
theproductionfunctionincreases therealism of themodelbecausethereare a numberof
factors that are unknown to the firm at the time it chooses the configuration and capacity
of its water distribution network. (A utility’s distribution network is a major component
of its capital stock.)
To account for all these forms of unobserved heterogeneity, Wolak must make para-
metric and distributional assumptions to identify the underlying economic primitives
from h(pQ,Q,X,C | pX,Z). Without these assumptions, it is impossible to proceed.
Once again, this illustrates our point that it is specific parametric economic and statis-
tical assumptions that allow us to go from the statistical joint distribution of the data,
h(pQ,Q,X,C | pX,Z), to statements about the production technologies, market de-
mand and information primitives.4390 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
The source of the utility’s private information is the efficiency of its labor input. To
this end, Wolak makes the distinction between, L∗
i , the amount of labor actually used
in the production process, and Li, the observed physical quantity of labor input which
is implied by the utility’s total labor costs. These two magnitudes are related by the
equationL∗
i = Li/d(θi), where d(θ) is a known increasing function and θi is interpreted
as utility i’s labor inefficiency parameter. (Higher values of θi imply more inefficiency.)
The econometrician and regulator observe the utility using the quantity of labor Li, but
the actual amount of “standardized” labor available in the production process is L∗
i .
This specification is based on the fact that labor costs are a major component of total
maintenance expenditures, and system maintenance is a major determinant of water
system efficiency. Thus, while the regulator can observe how much labor is employed
at the utility, Li, it does not know the productivity of this labor. The utility’s ex post
observed costs have the form wiLi +riKi +peiEi, where wi is the wage rate, ri is the
price of capital, and pei is the price of electricity. Note that the utility pays for observed
labor, Li.
From the viewpoint of the econometrician, θi is an unobservable random variable that
determines the productivity of labor. In this sense, it is comparable to other unobserv-
ables, such as 
Q
i . What is special about θi as an unobservable is that it may also be
unobserved by the regulator. This is the case of Model A, the asymmetric information
model. There, the regulator only knows the distribution of θi, F(θ), and thus can only
condition its decisions on that information – much like what happens in an auction. By
contrast, in the symmetric information model (Model S), the θi plays the role of unob-
served heterogeneity because the regulator and firm observe it but the econometrician
does not.
For both Model S and Model A, the utility chooses its input mix to maximize ex-
pected profits given its private information. Each utility faces the demand function
QD = Qi(pi)D
i for its product, where D
i is a positive, mean one stochastic shock
to demand. This shock is assumed independently and identically distributed across time
and utilities. Once p is set, the demand shock is realized; the utility then produces out-
put to satisfy demand (which in both models is known both to the regulator and the
utility).
Because the utility’s price and capital stock are set before the utility produces each
period, the utility’s desire to maximize expected profits will lead it to minimize to-
tal operating costs under both Models A and S for a fixed level of output and capital
stock. Thus, for each model, Wolak can compute a conditional variable cost function
CVC(pe,w,θ,K,Q,Q,ηL,ηE | β), where ηL and ηE are mean one optimization
errors. Wolak introduces these errors to allow for the fact that the first-order conditions
for L and E do not hold exactly. Note that the utility’s private information, θ, enters into
the conditional variable cost function.
Using this expression for variable costs, utility i’s total observed costs equal:
(123) TC = CVC(pe,w,θ,K,Q,q,ηL,ηE | β) + riKi.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4391
As noted earlier, the firm’s capital stock serves two roles: (1) it reduces the total cost of
serving demand; and, (2) it signals to the regulator the firm’s true productive efficiency.
This tension between increasing profits by choosing the minimum total cost level of
capital and increasing the size of the capital stock in an effort to be rewarded by the
regulator with a higher output price, leads to distortions from least-cost production by
the firm.
9.3.1. Symmetric information model
In the symmetric information model, the regulator observes each utility’s true θ and
sets the monthly fixed fee (F) and per unit price (p) to maximize expected consumer
surplus subject to the constraint that the utility’s expected profits (with respect to the
distributions of Q and D) equal zero. This implies that the regulator will solve for the
p,T, and K which maximize expected consumer surplus for the utility’s consumers.
Let Si(p) = ED(D
i )
∞
p Qi(s)ds denote expected consumer surplus for the ith
utility, where ED(.) denotes the expectation with respect to the distribution of D. In
terms of our notation, the regulator solves:

.
The fixed fee, T(θi), is set so that expected profits are zero at the values of K(θi) and
p(θi) that solve (125) and (126).
9.3.2. Asymmetric information model
In theasymmetricinformationmodel(ModelA), the regulatorrecognizesthattheutility
may mis-report θ as higher than it really is (i.e., the utility claims to be less efficient than
it really is). Consequently, the regulator constructs price, fixed fee and capital stock (as
a function of θ) such that given these schedules, the utility finds it profit-maximizing to4392 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
report its true θ. The regulator picks price, the fixed fee, and the capital stock that max-
imize expected (with respect to the distributions of θ, D, and Q) consumer surplus.
To derive the Model A equilibrium, Wolak follows the approach given in Baron
(1989). The first step is to determine the global truth-telling constraints. A utility with
true parameter θx that reports θy earns expected profit


p(θy)Q p(θy) D


(127) − rK(θy) + T(θy),
where we suppress the dependence of the minimum variable cost function (CVC) on
pe, w, Q and D, η and β. Consequently, for any two arbitrary values θ might take
for a given utility, say θx and θy, incentive compatibility requires EQD[π(θx,θx)] ⩾
EQD[π(θy,θx)], meaning that the firm expects to earn higher profits by announcing θx
when its true type is θx, than it expects to earn from announcing any other θy = θx. The
next step is to specify the local version of this global constraint:
(128)
dEQD[π(θ)]
dθ
= −
∂EQD[CVC(θ,K(θ),Q(θ))]
∂θ
,
for all θ ∈ [θl,θh]. Equation (128) is the local incentive compatibility condition that
quantifies how rapidly the regulator must raise the expected profits of a utility as its true
θ value falls (the utility becomes more efficient) in order to encourage truthful reve-
lation. By integrating (128), one obtains the expected profit function. This implies that
the expected profit function is locally decreasing in θ so that the participation constraint,
which requires the firm to earn nonnegative expected profits for all values of θ, can be
replaced by the single constraint that EQD[π(θh)] ⩾ 0, where θ lies in the interval
[θl,θh].
The regulator’s optimization problem is

Although Wolak does not explicitly include the restrictions implied by the global truth-
telling constraints, he derives restrictions on the regulatory environment and distribution
of θ necessary for the price, capital, and fixed fee functions that solve (129) to also
satisfy the global incentive compatibility constraints.
Note that the formulation in (129) refers specifically to the ith utility–regulator pair.
Because the regulator does not know utility i’s efficiency parameter, she must set p,T,Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4393
and K functions over the entire support of θ for each utility. Consequently, the regulator
must solve this problem for each utility that it regulates.
Wolak (1994) presents a detailed discussion of the derivation of the first-order con-
ditions for this optimization problem. For our purposes, we simply want to show how
these first-order conditions differ from those for the Model S solution. The first-order
conditions analogous to (125) and (126) for Model A are:
(130)


ηK,
where ηp and ηK are the mean one multiplicative optimization errors added for same
reasons given above in the discussion of the Model S solution. These two equations
determine the amount of capital stock K(θ) a utility of type θ will purchase, and the
price p(θ) it will be directed to charge. The demand function Qi(p) and these two
equations determine the two regulatory variables K(θ) and p(θ). The fixed fee T(θ) is
given by

for a utility of type θ∗. Once a utility’s K is chosen and its p and T are set, its de-
mands for L and E can be determined from the solution to the minimum operating cost
problem.
These first-order conditions demonstrate that the presence of asymmetric information
in the regulator–utility interaction leads to both deviations from minimum cost produc-
tion and efficient output prices in the sense that price differs from marginal cost. As
discussed above, this deviation from minimum cost production occurs because the firm
also uses its capital stock to signal to the regulator its greater productive efficiency and
therefore lower value of θ.
9.4. Econometric model
Following our procedure outlined in Section 4 for constructing structural economet-
ric models, this section discusses the functional form of the production function Qi =
f(Ki,L∗
i ,Ei,Q | β) and derives the cost function which is used to recover an estimate
oftheparametervectorβ.Wethendiscussthespecificationofdistributionsforthestruc-
tural disturbances introduced into the model and derive the likelihood function. Wolak’s
model contains the first three types of disturbances discussed in Section 4: (1) unob-
served heterogeneity in the form of the utility’s private information θi, (2) shocks which
agents in the model optimize against (Q and D), (3) optimization errors which allow4394 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
agents’ first-order conditions to only be satisfied in expectation (ηj, j = L,E,K,p).
Appendix A of Wolak (1994) shows that the composite errors to the structural equations
are functions of these disturbances.
Wolak’s choice of fairly simple functional forms for the production function and de-
mand function allows him to impose conditions on the parameters of the underlying
econometric model that guarantee a solution to the regulator’s problem. More flexible
functional forms for Qi = f(Ki,L∗
i ,Ei,Q | β) would not allow this. These func-
tional forms allow constraints on the parameters of the economic environment which
guarantee the existence of a Model A solution. These functional forms allow Wolak
to perform counterfactual experiments with his parameter estimates which illustrate
several important empirical distinctions among Model S, Model A, and conventional
estimation procedures.
Wolak uses the Cobb–Douglas production function Q = β0KβK (L/d(θ))βLEβE Q,
where d(θ) = θ(βL+βE)/βL. The demand function for the utility’s output is
(133) Qd =
&
exp(Zb)p−κD if p ⩽ pmax,
0 if p > pmax,
where Z is a vector of utility service area characteristics assumed shift demand, b is a
parameter vector associated with Z, κ is the elasticity demand for water, and pmax is the
price beyond which demand for the firm’s output is zero.
Solving the minimum operating cost problem for this production function yields the
following (conditional on K) variable cost function:

Taking the partial derivative of the expected value of this cost variable function,
EQD[CVC], with respect to K and inserting it into the first-order condition for the
symmetric information regulatory outcome with respect to K, yields the following un-
conditional variable cost (VC) function:

(137) δ =

.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4395
The only difference between this unconditional variable cost function and the usual
Cobb–Douglas unconditional variable cost function is the presence of the utility’s pri-
vate information, θ.
We should emphasize that because it excludes capital costs, this is the utility’s min-
imum variable cost function conditional on θ – not the minimum total cost function.
Although it is straightforward to derive the utility’s minimum total cost function from
(125), Wolak departs from the tradition of estimating a total cost function for the fol-
lowing reason. Operating or variable costs are measured with little if any error, whereas,
capital cost (the missing ingredient necessary to compute total production costs) is
extremely poorly measured. Rather than complicate the analysis with potentially sub-
stantial measurement error, he instead uses the variable cost function to estimate the
same parameters of the utility’s production function that can be recovered by estimating
a total cost function.
To derive the asymmetric information cost function, substitute the partial derivative
of the expected value of the variable cost function, EQD(CVC), with respect to K into
the first-order condition for the optimal capital stock given in (130). Simplifying this
expression gives the following variable cost function:
(138) VC(A) = D∗

pe(1−α−γ)
Qδ
dν,
where H(θ) = [θ + F(θ)
f(θ)]. The parameters α, γ and δ are as defined above.
The final step toward developing the structural econometric model is to specify distri-
butions for all of the stochastic shocks to the econometric model. This step is needed to
derive the likelihood function for the variable cost functions under the two information
structures. Wolak requires that ν be lognormally distributed with ln(ν) ∼ N(μν,σ2
ν )
independent across time and utilities.
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of (135) gives the following symmetric
information logarithm-of-variable-costs equation:
ln VC(S) = ξ∗
+ (1 − α)ln(θ) + γ ln(w) + α ln(r) + (1 − α − γ)ln(pe)
(139) + δ ln(Qd) + ζ,
where ξ∗ = ln(D∗)+μν and ζ = ln(ν)−μν. Therefore, ζ is N(0,σ2
ζ ), where σ2
ζ = σ2
ν .
Repeating this procedure for Equation (138) yields the asymmetric information log-of-
variable-costs equation:
ln VC(A) = ξ∗
− α ln H(θ) + γ ln(w) + α ln(r) + (1 − α − γ)ln(pe)
(140) + δ ln(Qd) + ζ.
The final step of the process is to define the likelihood function for each informa-
tion structure. First we define notation which simplifies the presentation. Let Γ ∗ =
(ξ∗,α,γ,δ). Define X = (ln(r),ln(w),ln(pe)), q = ln(Qd), and Y = ln(VC). In
this notation we can abbreviate Equations (139) and (140) as:
(141) Y = ΩY (X,q,Γ ∗
,θ) + ζ,4396 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
(142) Y = ΨY (X,q,Γ ∗
,θ) + ζ,
where ΩY (X,q,Γ ∗,θ) is the right-hand side of (139) excluding ζ and ΨY (X,q,Γ ∗,θ)
is the right-hand side of (140) excluding ζ.
We now derive the likelihood function and discuss the estimation procedure for the
case of Model S. Following this discussion, we describe the additional complications
introduced by Model A. Under Wolak’s assumptions on the functional form for the
productionfunctionandtheaggregatedemandfunctiontheequilibriumvalueof q under
Model S is
(143) q = Z
,X
,ln(θ) Λ∗
+ ψ,
where Λ∗ is the vector of coefficients associated with (Z,X,ln(θ)) and ψ is assumed
to be joint normally distributed with ζ. Let ρζ,ψ denote the correlation between ζ and
ψ. Finally, define Λ = (Λ∗
,σ2
ψ,ρζ,ψ). Conditional on the value of θ, Equations (141)
and (143) make up a triangular system of simultaneous equations. The determinant of
the Jacobian of the transformation from (ζ,ψ) to (Y,q) is one, so that the joint density
of (Y,q) conditional on θ, X and Z is

where Γ = (Γ ∗,σζ). Note that θ enters both (141) and (143) only through ln(θ), so
that without loss of generality we can express hS(·,·) as a function of ln(θ). Because θ is
unobservable, to construct the likelihood function in terms of the observable variables,
we must compute the density of (Y,q) given X and Z only. To obtain this density we
integrate the conditional density hS(Y,q | ln(θ),Γ,Λ) with respect to the density of θ.
Integrating with respect to the density of θ, yields
(145) g Y,q | X,Z,Γ,λ,F(.) =
 θh
θl
hS Y,q | X,Z,ln(θ),Γ f(θ)d(θ).
This likelihood function is similar to Porter’s regime switching model likelihood func-
tion. In Porter’s case It is the unobserved regime indicator and in the present case θ is
a continuously distributed random variable with compact support. In the same way that
Porter was able to identify the density of It from his assumption of conditional nor-
mality of the density of equilibrium price and quantity, Wolak (1994) is able to identify
the distribution of θ from the joint normality assumptions of Y and q. In addition, in
the same sense that the economic structure of competitive and collusive pricing regimes
was identified by the conditional normality assumption in Porter’s model, the primitives
of the private information regulator–utility interaction are identified by the conditional
normality assumption in Wolak’s model.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4397
The construction of the likelihood function for the asymmetric information case pro-
ceeds in an analogous fashion, with the major complication being the presence of H(θ),
which is a function of both f(θ) and F(θ) in both regression equations. The conditional
density of (Y,q) given θ, X and Z under Model A takes the same form as for Model S
with Equation (141) replaced by Equation (142) and the log-output Equation (143) re-
placed by the following equation:
(146) q = X
,Z
,ln(θ),ln H(θ) Φ + ψ,
where Φ is the vector of coefficients associated with (X,Z,ln(θ),ln(H(θ))).
The conditional distribution of Y and q given Z, X, and θ for this information struc-
ture, hA(Y,q | X,Z,θ), depends on θ through both ln(θ) and ln(H(θ)). To construct
the likelihood in terms of only observables, we integrate this conditional density with
respect to f(θ) over the interval [θl,θh].
For both Model S and Model A, conventional maximum likelihood estimation proce-
dures can be applied to compute the coefficient estimates and their standard errors.
9.5. Estimation results
A major goal of the empirical analysis is to recover characteristics of production
process, and in particular, the returns to scale in production, accounting for the impact
of the utility’s private information. Wolak finds that applying conventional minimum
cost function Cobb–Douglas estimation techniques, the returns to scale estimates ob-
tained that are implausibly high, with cost elasticities with respect to output estimates
as high as 0.77, which means that a 10 percent increase in output only increases total
costs by 7.7%. Other estimates were even lower. However, applying the maximum like-
lihood estimation techniques outlined above for the Model S and Model A solutions,
Wolak finds cost elasticities with respect to output greater than 1, for both the Model S
and Model A estimates, which implies slight decreasing returns to scale in production,
although the null hypothesis of constant returns to scale cannot be rejected. This dra-
matic difference in returns to scale estimates points out the importance of controlling
for this unobserved firm-level heterogeneity in productive efficiency when attempting
to recover consistent estimates of the characteristics of the regulated firm’s production
process.
Wolak is also able to recover estimates of F(θ), which determines the form of the op-
timal regulatory contract under asymmetric information. Armed with this information
he is able to compute the following counterfactuals for each point in his dataset using
the Model A parameter estimates. First, he computes the ratio of total operating costs
under a Model A solution versus the Model S solution holding constant the level of out-
put produced by the firm under both scenarios. This answers the question of how much
less costly, in terms of variable costs, it is to produce a given level of output under the
Model A versus Model S versions of the regulatory process. Wolak also performs this
same counterfactual for total production costs and finds that in terms of total produc-
tion costs, the same level of output costs approximately 5–10 percent more to provide4398 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
under the Model A regulatory process relative to the Model S regulatory process. These
distortions from minimum cost production occur because the more efficient firms find
it profitable to signal their superior productive efficiency to the regulator through their
capital stock choice.
Wolak also computes the welfare cost to consumers from asymmetric information by
comparing the market-clearing level of output under the Model A solution versus the
Model S solution for the same values of the input prices and θ. He finds the output level
produced under the Model A solution is roughly 20 percent less than the level of output
under the Model S solution for the Model A parameter estimates, which indicates a
significant welfare loss to consumers associated with asymmetric information.
In an attempt to see whether Model A or Model S provides a statistically superior de-
scription of the observed data, Wolak performs a nonnested hypothesis test of Model A
versus Model S. He finds that Model A provides a statistically significantly superior de-
scription of the observed data relative to Model S. As discussed in Section 3, this does
not validate Model A as the true model for the regulatory process. It only states that for
the same functional forms and economic primitives, the strategic interaction implied by
Model A provides a statistically superior description of the observed data.
9.6. Further extensions
There are variety of directions for future research in this area given the enormous
number of competing theoretical models of the private information regulator–utility in-
teraction. Sorting through the empirical implications of these models across a variety
of regulated industries would help to focus future theoretical and empirical research in
this area. Recent work in this area includes: Dalen and Gomez-Lobo (1997) who study
the impact of these incentive contracts in the Norwegian Bus Transport Industry and
Gagnepain and Ivaldi (2002) who assess the impact of incentive regulatory policies for
public transit systems in France.
10. Market structure and firm turnover
So far we have discussed IO models in which the number of market participants (e.g.,
firms or bidders) is given. IO economists have recently devoted considerable energy
toward modeling how changes in market structure can affect the extent of competition
in a market. In particular, the theoretical literature has explored two related questions:
1. “How many competitors are needed to insure effective competition?” and
2. “What factors encourage firms to enter markets?”
Theoretical answers to these questions often hinge delicately on the assumptions made
about firms’ costs, market demand and firms’ conjectures about competitors’ behavior.
Unfortunately, there are very few structural econometric models that would allow one to
identify the empirical relevance of demand, cost and strategic explanations. In large partCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4399
this is because competition models in which the number of participants is endogenous
are complicated and difficult to solve.
Only recently have empirical researchers begun to make progress in developingstruc-
tural econometric models that can speak to specific strategic models of entry and entry
deterrence. In this section we outline some of the econometric issues associated with
modeling the number of firms in oligopolistic markets. Again, our intent is not so much
tosurveytheliteratureastoshowwhatonecanlearnfrominformationaboutthenumber
and identities of firms in a market.32 We shall see that while structural models of entry,
exit and market structure raise many of the modeling issues discussed in Sections 5–9,
there are also new issues.
10.1. Overview of the issues
Sections 5–7 showed how economists have used information about the joint density of
prices and quantities f(P,Q | X,Z) = f(P1,...,PN,Q1,...,QN | X,Z) to re-
cover information about firms’ demand curves and costs. In general, the conditional
density f(·) is a statistical object, and a high-dimensional one at that. In practice this
means that it would be hopeless to try and estimate a 2 × N conditional joint density
nonparametrically from market-level data. While going to consumer-level data can im-
prove inferences, in general it will be extremely difficult to obtain the representative
consumer-level datasets necessary to estimate flexible and yet precise estimates of firm-
level demands. These observations suggest that considerable economic structure will
have to be introduced if one is to obtain meaningful estimates of firms’ demands and
costs.
The literatures discussed in Sections 5–9 presume that the number of firms is exoge-
nous. One consequence of this assumption is that N enters objects such as f(P,Q |
X,Z) as a conditioning variable rather than something to be explained. One way to
make N endogenous is to imagine that each market has the same M > N poten-
tial entrants. Each of these potential entrants makes a discrete decision whether or
not to enter. The conditional density of the market data and these entry decisions is
f(P1,...,PM,Q1,...,QM,a1,...,aM | X,Z,W,M). Here, the ai are zero-one
indicators for whether or not potential entrant i has entered and W are any new con-
ditioning variables.
This expression makes it easy to appreciate why many studies do not make N en-
dogenous. First, there are many different collections of the ai that yield the same N.
In principle, the researcher might wish to explain not just N but why a particular or-
dering of the ai was obtained. Second, because the dimensionality of f(·) has gone up
considerably, it becomes even more difficult to estimate nonparametrically. For exam-
ple, it seems unlikely that a researcher would have a large sample of markets that have
the same number of potential entrants M. Finally, the form of f(·) may differ with the
identities of each entrant.

Because nonparametric methods are impractical, the researcher will have to impose
economic structure to get anywhere. In particular, now the researcher will have to add
equations that explain each of the ai. These conditions must explain why some but not
other potential entrants entered the market.
Our discussion so far has dealt with more obvious complications introduced by mak-
ing N and the identities of entrants endogenous. There are less obvious complications
as well. Two of the most critical are that: (1) the underlying theory may deliver am-
biguous predictions about which firms will enter in equilibrium; and, (2) the underlying
theory may deliver no (pure-strategy) predictions about which firms will enter in equi-
librium. These are new complexities, ones we did not really see in Sections 5–9. Before
we explore their significance for structural modeling, it is useful to back up and provide
a broader sense of the types of economic issues that one might hope to address with
structural models of market concentration and competition.
10.1.1. Airline competition and entry
Since the deregulation of US passenger airline markets in the late 1970s, travelers and
economistshavespeculatedaboutwhether sufficientcompetitionexists in different city-
pair markets.33 One does not have to look far to understand why. Travelers routinely
encounter wide disparities in an airline’s fares (per seat mile) over time, across routes
and even for seats on the same flight. Despite this considerable variation in a given air-
line’s fares, there appears to be much less variation in fares across competing carriers.
Industry critics contend that such patterns are obvious evidence of ineffective com-
petition. They also argue that high concentration on some individual city-pair routes
contributes to the problem. Some industry advocates argue the opposite. They contend
that fare matching is evidence of competition, and that fare differences at worst reflect
price discrimination. Some also claim that high concentration is evidence of economies
of scale and route density, and that entry (or the threat of entry) of small upstart carriers
is enough to insure effective competition.
These two views provide a challenge to IO economists, and there have been many
attempts to distinguish between them. To delve deeper, it is useful to imagine that we
have data (consistent with the US experience) indicating that short haul routes between
small cities tend to be highly concentrated and have high (per seat mile) fares. The
technological and demand explanation for this correlation is that the costs of service on
these routes is high relative to demand. Thus, some routes will have so little demand
relative to costs, that at most one firm can profitably serve the market. This one firm
would behave as a monopolist and charge high prices to recover its costs. The anti-
competitive explanation for the observed correlation is that high concentration and fares
are the result of strategic behavior. For example, even if the small market could support
## 33 See for example Borenstein (1992), Brueckner, Dryer and Spiller (1992), Morrison and Winston (1996),
Ott (1990), and Windle (1993).Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4401
many carriers, dominant carriers can convince potential entrants that entry would be
met with stiff competition.
Can we distinguish between these explanations? Our answer is: given the current
state of the theory, econometric models and data, we cannot generally. The main reason
is that much of what the theory points us toward is unobservable. Researchers do not
observe the marginal and fixed costs that are central to technological explanations. We
also do not observe potential entrants’ expectations about incumbent behavior, which
are central to strategic explanations. Does this mean we cannot learn anything from a
structural model of market structure? The answer to this is no.
What we can imagine doing in principle is building structural models that would
examine how alternative competitive models fit the data. For instance, we might begin
in the spirit of the models in Sections 5–7 by writing down functional forms for city-pair
demand, and firms’ fixed and variable costs. This is not, however, as easy as it sounds.
Prior studies have documented that airlines’ costs of service depend in complex ways
not only on route-specific factors, such as miles traveled, airport fees, etc., but also on
network and fleet characteristics (e.g., whether the plane will carry passengers beyond
a city or transfer passengers at a hub and code-sharing agreements). Nevertheless, we
might attempt a parametric model of demand and costs. At that point, unlike most of the
models in Sections 5–7, we would have to grapple with the problem that the number of
carriers in a market is endogenous: it is affected by demand and supply conditions. We
therefore also have to model how fixed and marginal costs impact the number of firms
in the market (and possibly the identities of those firms).
Here, we encounter tricky specification issues. Economic theory suggests that to
model the number of firms we need to model why (and possibly which) firms did not
enter. But this involves modeling potential entrants’ expectations about what would
happen after entry, something we never observe. Moreover, because the same carriers
compete with each other in other markets, we may have to model how actions in any
one market affect outcomes in other markets.
At this point, it might seem that a complete structural model of airline competition is
hopeless. There is, however, something that we can learn with the right data. The critical
events that tell us something about competition and market structure are instances of
entry and exit. Consider, for example, our sample of small markets. In principle, we
observe some city-pair markets in which there is no (direct) service, others in which
there is a monopoly, a duopoly, and so on. If (and this is an important if) we can control
for factors that might lead to cost of service and demand differences across markets,
then we can ask how much demand does it take to support at least one carrier. This level
of demand tells us something about a single carrier’s fixed and marginal costs relative
to demand. We can then compare this level of demand to what it takes to support a
second firm in the market. This level of demand tells us more about costs and potentially
behavior. Suppose, for instance, we do not observe a second carrier enter a city-pair
market until demand is roughly twenty times what it takes to support a single carrier.
One’s intuition is that if the second carrier has the same costs and product as the first,4402 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
that this difference must reflect pessimism on the part of the second carrier as to value
of entering a monopoly market.
It is this type of intuition that structural models of the number of firms, or entry
and exit seek to make more precise. That is, the goal of a structural model is to show
how changes in population and other exogenous market conditions affect the (apparent)
ability of potential entrants to cover costs. The primary value of a formal model is
that it makes clear what economic and stochastic assumptions are necessary, given the
available data, to isolate differences between firms’ costs and the expectations they have
about post-entry competition.
10.2. An economic model and data
Our airline example makes three points that are worth emphasizing. First, debates about
the competitiveness of markets often hinge on assumptions about what determines a
market’s structure (e.g., the number of firms). Second, some of the most critical factors
affecting the ease of entry and exit are unobservable (e.g., firms’ fixed and marginal
costs, and expectations about post-entry competition). Third, while we can potentially
use structural models to draw inferences about the unobservables present in IO theories,
these models, like all structural models, will contain untestable assumptions. These as-
sumptions may be too numerous to be credible.
An important corollary to this third point is that the form of the data available will
have an important impact on what we can estimate. In our airline example, for instance,
we might have data on a cross section of similar city-pair markets or time series data
on the same market over time. Both of these data sets raise modeling issues. In cross-
section data we have to worry about changes in the identity and number of potential
entrants across markets. We may also have to worry that the behavior of firms in one
market may affect their behavior in other markets. While time-series data have the ad-
vantage of holding constant market-specific conditions, researchers must again worry
that the firms’ decisions may be linked through time. When they are, it makes sense to
model firms’ decisions using dynamic games. While some progress has been made in
formulating and solving such games, to date their computational demands have largely
made them impractical for empirical work. As a consequence, almost all structural mar-
ket structure models are static.
Most empirical work in this area has tended to rely on cross-section data. As such
they focus on modeling which firms are producing, as opposed to firm turnover; i.e.,
which firms are entering or exiting. In a typical cross-section application, a researcher
might have data on
1. the number of potential entrants into each market, M;
2. the entry decisions of each potential entrant: a = (a1,a2,...,aN);
3. market-specific information X (e.g., market size); and
4. firm-specific information, Z = (z1,z2,...,zM) (e.g., identities and product char-
acteristics).Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4403
In addition, in an ideal application the researcher may also observe the prices and quan-
tities of actual entrants: P1,...,PN and Q1,...,QN.
In an ideal setting, the structural modeler would like to use this information to esti-
mate firm-level demand and cost specifications, such as those discussed in Sections 5–8.
Unlike these previous models, however, assumptions about firms’ fixed costs will now
play an important role in these models, as fixed costs help determine which set of firms
will produce. Additionally, assumptions about the timing of firms’ decisions and the
amount of information they possess become critical. These assumptions are important
because, unlike in previous models, they have a critical impact on whether the empiri-
cal model has a pure-strategy equilibrium and whether any pure-strategy equilibrium is
unique. In what follows, we use a series of models advanced by Bresnahan and Reiss
(1991a, 1991b) to highlight some of these issues and the strengths and weaknesses of
structural models.34
Bresnahan and Reiss develop econometric models to explain the number of sellers in
several different localized product markets (such as dental services, new car dealers and
movietheaters).Foreachproduct,theymodelhowthenumberofsellersinatownvaries
with the town’s population, and other demand and cost variables. The goal of their work
is to understand how technological, demand and strategic factors affect market structure
and competition. Like the airline example, they propose to do this by estimating how
much demand it takes to support different numbers of firms. Unlike the airline example,
however, the authors only have information on the number of firms in each market
and their identities a = (a1,...,aM); they do not have price or quantity information.
Thus, absent a structural model, the best they can do is summarize the conditional joint
distribution of entry decisions given industry and firm characteristics. Such an approach
is not that dissimilar from that taken in Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson (1988). When
developing a structural model, Bresnahan and Reiss must take into account the fact that
entry and exit are discrete events. Thus, their structural models will not typically involve
marginal conditions, such as those used in the models of Sections 5, 6 and 7. Instead,
they must rely on threshold conditions for entrants’ unobserved profits.
The threshold conditions that Bresnahan and Reiss use come from simple static,
perfect-information entry games. An example of such a game is the standard two-firm,
simultaneous-move entry game. The payoffs to the players in this game are:
Stay out (a2 = 0) Enter (a2 = 1)
Stay out (a1 = 0) Π1(0,0) Π2(0,0) Π1(0,1) Π2(0,1)
Enter (a1 = 1) Π1(1,0) Π2(1,0) Π1(1,1) Π2(1,1)
where the Πk(a1,a2) represent the profits firm k earns when firm 1 plays a1 and firm 2
plays a2 (a zero denotes the action “Stay Out” and a one denotes “Enter”). In most
34 See also the work of Berry (1992) and other references cited in Berry and Reiss (in press).4404 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
textbook examples, the numbers in the payoff matrix are hypothetical. The economist
then adds assumptions about players’ information and a solution concept.
Bresnahan and Reiss’ structural models build on this strategic representation of an
entry game. Their econometric models postulate that the researcher observes the play-
ers’ equilibrium action(s) in each sample market (e.g., a1 = 0 and a2 = 1) but does not
observe the firms’ economic profits (the Πk(0,1)). The logic of their models is to use a
specific equilibrium solution concept to work backward from the observed equilibrium
action(s) to statements about unobserved profits. Thus, the “structure” in their structural
model are the economic and stochastic assumptions that allow them to go from dis-
crete data to statements about continuous-valued profits. It should not be too surprising
given our discussions in Sections 5–9, that Bresnahan and Reiss will have to introduce
considerable structure in order to draw inferences about firm profits and behavior from
discrete outcomes.
10.3. Modeling profits and competition
To understand the process by which Bresnahan and Reiss work from firms’ observed
actions back to statements about firms’ unobserved profits, and to see what one can
hope to estimate, it is useful to work with a specific entry model. To keep matters sim-
ple, imagine that we are modeling the number of symmetric firms, N, that produce
a homogeneous good. The goal of the empirical analysis is to use the information in
the zero-one entry indicators a1,a2,...,aM of the M ⩾ N potential entrants to draw
inferences about firms’ profit functions, i.e.,
(147) Πk(a1,a2,...,aM,X,Z,W,θ).
Here X,Z, and W represents exogenous observables affecting demand and costs, and θ
represents parameters of the profit function (e.g., demand and cost function parameters)
that we wish to estimate. While the firms’ profit functions could in principle include
prices and quantities, Bresnahan and Reiss do not have this information. They thus
are forced to work with profit functions where these endogenous variables have been
substituted out.
The first step in the modeling process is to use assumptions about demand, costs and
how firms compete to derive the functional form of Equation (147). Here Bresnahan
and Reiss are helped by the presumption that if a potential entrant does not enter, it
likely will earn zero profit – regardless of what the other potential entrants do. If firm
i does enter, its profits depend on the number of other firms that enter (as summarized
in the aj). The exact way in which the number of other firms affects profits depends on
what one assumes about demand, costs and competition. If, for example, firms have the
same constant marginal cost c, have fixed costs of F, compete as Cournot competitors,
and market demand is p = α − bQ, then one can show
(148) Πk(a1,a2,...,aM,Z,θ) = b

S

2

where S = (α −c)/b is a measure of the potential size of the market. For firm i to have
entered along with N −1 other firms it must be the case that Πi ⩾ 0. Similarly, if there
is free entry, then it must be that the (N + 1)st entrant found it unprofitable to enter.
These two bounds imply

.
These inequalities provide useful information. For instance, if we know or could esti-
mate the size of the market S and the slope of demand b, then we can place a bound on
firms’ unobserved fixed costs. While it is plausible to imagine having external measures
of the market’s size, S, it is much less likely one would have prior information about
b. One solution would be to use price and quantity data to estimate b, yet this is ex-
actly the problem that Bresnahan and Reiss have – they do not have price and quantity
information.
The question then is what can one infer about demand and cost conditions from a
cross section of markets? Bresnahan and Reiss’ idea is to use information on the number
of firms in very small to very large markets to estimate a sequence of so-called entry
thresholds. These thresholds are a simple transformation of the market sizes S1,S2,...
above, where Si represents the size of the market just needed to support i firms. While
the entry threshold levels are of limited use, their ratios are revealing. For example, if
we take the ratio of the duopoly to the monopoly entry threshold assuming firms are
Cournot competitors we get
(149)
S2

= 2.25.
That is, we should observe a second firm entering at 2.25 the size of the market required
to support one firm. Similar calculations can be done for entry threshold ratios involving
higher numbers of identical firms.
Of course, we need not observe the estimated (or observed) duopoly-monopoly
threshold ratio equal to 2.25 (or the higher-order ratios consistent with this symmet-
ric Cournot model). The question then is what should we infer? The answer is that
economic theory can provide some suggestions. We can consider, for example, what
happens when we change the assumption about how the duopolists compete. If the
second entrant expects the monopolist to collude with it after entry, then the duopoly
to monopoly ratio would equal 2.0. The three-firm to monopoly entry threshold ratio
would be 3.0, and so on. Alternatively, if the second firm expected perfect competition
(or Bertrand competition) post entry, we would never observe the second firm enter this
natural monopoly. Thus, we can see that the degree of competition affects the entry
threshold ratio. While we might be tempted to think the entry threshold ratio then is
indicative of the degree of competition, with larger ratios suggesting more competition
post entry, this is only true if we maintain our other assumptions. If, for example, we
had used a quadratic cost function with increasing marginal costs, we also would see4406 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
changes in the entry threshold ratios as minimum efficient scale changes [see Bresnahan
and Reiss (1991a)].
This last point brings us back to a point we made in the introduction: inferences in
structural models typically depend heavily on maintained functional form assumptions.
We often do not have the data to test these assumptions. In this application, for example,
the absence of price and quantity data considerably limit what we can infer. Does this
suggest that this structural model has little value because we have to make untestable
assumptions? Our answer is no. The model has value because it makes clear what one
can and cannot infer from the data. It also points future research toward what it is that
one needs to observe to draw sharper inferences.
10.4. The econometric model
Our discussion so far has largely been based on an economic model with symmetric
firms. We have yet to introduce stochastic assumptions or discuss the more realistic
cases where there are observed and unobserved differences among firms. These addi-
tions introduce further complexities.
Recall that the data Bresnahan and Reiss have are the number of potential entrants M,
the number (and possibly the identities) of the actual entrants, and demand and cost
variables. Starting from primitive demand and cost function assumptions, they build a
model of firms’ equilibrium profits, which consists of a variable profit and a fixed cost
term
(150) Π̄k(a,Z,θ) = VPi(a,Z,θ) − Fi(a,Z,θ).
Here, a is a vector describing the M potential entrants’ entry actions, VP denotes vari-
able profits, F fixed costs and i subscripts potential entrants. Although this expression
depends on observable variables, the econometrician does not typically observe every-
thing the firm does. Following the discrete choice literature popularized by McFadden,
Heckman, and others, we might simply add an error term, , to profits to account for
what we do not observe. Notice, however, that by assuming that the error is additive,
we have placed structure on what it is about profits that the econometrician does not ob-
serve. Specifically, whatever it is that the econometrician does not observe, it enters the
firms’ optimal choices of prices and quantities in such a way that we obtain an additive
error in Equation (150). What types of unobservables do and do not fit this specifica-
tion? If we assume that the firms have unobserved differences in their constant marginal
costs, then we will not obtain an additive error specification. On the other hand, if we
assume that firms have different fixed costs, then we will. (This is because the marginal
conditions for prices or quantities do not depend on the unobservable fixed cost.) Thus,
while it is possible to justify the unrestricted additive structure in (150), it may make
more economic sense to entertain alternative stochastic specifications for profits.
Assuming that the unobserved portion of profits is additive, we are now in a position
to write down expressions for the equilibrium threshold conditions on firm profits. Fol-
lowing the discrete choice literature, we might consider modeling entry as the event thatCh. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4407
the firm i’s latent profits exceeds 0, or
(151) VPi(a,Z,θ) − F̃i(a,Z,θ) ⩾ i(a),
where the tilde above fixed costs denotes fixed cost up to an additive mean zero error.
This model looks like a standard threshold condition in a conventional discrete choice
model. The key difference is that the threshold conditions in the entry model contain the
endogenous ai variables. In other words, unlike in the standard discrete choice model,
here agents’ discrete decisions are interrelated. We therefore have to model simultane-
ously the N potential entrants’ threshold conditions. This is the source of additional
complications.
There is some precedent in the discrete choice literature for threshold conditions that
include dummy endogenous variables (the ai). For example, the household labor supply
literature sometimes descriptively models the dependence of a household head’s labor
supply decision on their spouse’s labor supply decision. Amemiya (1974) and others
have studied the econometric properties of latent variable models that include dummy
endogenous variables. Heckman (1978) introduced a systematic formulation of linear
dummy endogenous variable models and discussed a variety of econometric issues as-
sociated with the formulation and estimation of such models. In particular, he and others
have noted that arbitrary specifications of dummy endogenous variable models can lead
to “coherency” and identification problems.
Bresnahan and Reiss showed that one could use the economic structure of discrete
games to produce structural choice models with Heckman’s econometric structure.
Moreover, the identification issues that arise in Heckman’s models often have natural
economic interpretations. To see some of the connections, let us return to the normal
form entry game above. Recall that the idea of Bresnahan and Reiss is to draw in-
ferences about the unobserved payoffs from the observed equilibrium actions of the
entrants. To link the observed actions to the payoffs, we employ an equilibrium solu-
tion concept. An obvious one to employ in analyzing an entry game is that of a Nash
equilibrium. An outcome {a∗
1,a∗
2} of the entry game is a Nash equilibrium if
(152) Π1 a∗

foranya1 anda2.Tomakeclear theconnectionbetweentheNashequilibriumoutcomes
and payoffs, we can rewrite the two-by-two entry game as:
Stay out (a2 = 0) Enter (a2 = 1)
Stay out (a1 = 0) Π1(0,0) Π2(0,0) Π1(0,1) Π2(0,0) + Δ2

where the Δ’s represent the incremental profits to each firm of entry. From the definition
of a Nash equilibrium and the above payoff matrix we can deduce
a1 = 0 ⇐⇒ Δ1
0 + a2Δ1
1 ⩽ 0,4408 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
(153) a2 = 0 ⇐⇒ Δ2
0 + a1Δ2
1 ⩽ 0.
These conditions link the observed actions to profits. Specifically, they tell us that all
that the econometrician can infer from the observed equilibrium actions are statements
about the Δ terms. In the case of a Nash equilibrium, we see this means that the econo-
metrician cannot estimate Π1(0,1) and Π2(1,0), which are the profits the firms earn
when it is out of the market. This makes perfect sense, as we can only learn about prof-
its when a firm enters. To understand what we can estimate, it is useful to analyze the
Δ’s. The Δi
0 term are the incremental profits that firm i earns in a monopoly. We might
naturally think of this incremental profit as monopoly variable profits minus fixed costs,
net of opportunity costs. The Δi
1 terms are the profits that firm i gains (loses) relative to
its incremental monopoly profit when it enters its competitor’s monopoly market. This
profit is most naturally thought of as the loss in variable profit from moving from a
monopoly to a duopoly.
From assumptions about the structure of demand and costs, we can relate the incre-
mental profit terms to underlying demand and cost variables and parameters. For exam-
ple, in the symmetric linear demand and cost Cournot example, where Πi(0,0) = 0 we
have
Δi
0 =
(α − c)2
4b
− F = g(α,c) − F,
(154) Δi
1 =
5(α − c)2
36b
= h(α,c).
Knowing this relationship between the Δ’s and the underlying economic parameters,
we can proceed to add error terms to the model to generate stochastic specifications.
Assuming Fi = F + i gives the following latent variable system
(155) ai =
&
1 if y∗
i = g(α,c) − F + ajh(α,c) − i ⩾ 0,
0 if y∗
i = g(α,c) − F + ajh(α,c) − i < 0,
for i = 1,2 and i = j. This system bears a resemblance to Heckman’s (1978) linear
dummy endogenous variable systems. For instance, if we ignore the demand and cost
parameters in g(·) and h(·), assume Δi
1 is a constant, and Δi
0 = Xβi, where X is a
vector of observable variables and βi is a vector of parameters, then we obtain the linear
dummy endogenous variable system
(156) ai =
&
1 if y∗
i = Xβi + ajδ − i ⩾ 0,
0 if y∗
i = Xβi + ajδ − i < 0.
Amemiya, Heckman, Maddala and others have noted we cannot estimate the above
systems in general if the errors have unbounded support. The reason for this is that
the reduced form is not always well defined for all values of the errors. Bresnahan
and Reiss show that this econometric problem has a natural economic interpretation:
namely, it is indicative of two types of problems with the underlying game. First, if the
errors are unrestricted. the underlying game may have multiple pure-strategy equilibria.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4409
Second, the underlying game may have no pure-strategy equilibria. These existence and
uniqueness problems cause havoc with pure-strategy reduced forms.
One proposed solution to these problems is to assume that the model is recursive.
This econometric solution, however, has unattractive economic implications for an en-
try game. Specifically, it amounts to assuming that a competitor’s entry into a monopoly
market does not affect the monopolist’s profits. Thus, while this assumption is compu-
tationally attractive, it is economically and empirically unrealistic.
Bresnahan and Reiss go on to suggest how one can impose restrictions on profits
that remove existence problems. They also suggest a solution for the nonuniqueness
problem, which is to aggregate the nonunique outcomes (in this case the nonunique
outcomes occur when one firm or the other firm could be a profitable monopolist) to
obtain an economic model of the number of firms in the market, rather than a model
of which firms are in the market. Bresnahan and Reiss also explore how changing the
solution concept for the entry model changes the econometric structure of the game.
The main one they explore is how changing the game from simultaneous-move Nash
to sequential-move Stackleberg. In the latter case, the entry game generically has a
unique equilibrium. The econometric model of this equilibrium also has a threshold
interpretation, but it is more complicated than the simple linear structure above.
10.5. Estimation
Turning now to estimation, Bresnahan and Reiss (1991a) propose maximum likelihood
methods for estimating the parameters of profits. In their empirical work, they focus on
estimating models where the number of potential entrants is small. A key assumption in
their work is that they actually know the number of potential entrants, and therefore the
numberof thresholdconditionstoimpose. In muchof their work, theyignoresystematic
differences in firms’ profits and focus instead on modeling the number of firms that will
enter geographically distinct markets. In particular, Bresnahan and Reiss assume that
the demand for the products they look at is proportional to a town’s current and future
population size, and that the per capita demands for these products does not depend on
population. This allows them to express market demand as Q = D(Z,P)S, where S
is the “size” of the market. To simplify the analysis, Bresnahan and Reiss assume that
sellers are the same, apart from potential differences in fixed costs.
Using these assumptions, Bresnahan and Reiss derive expressions for equilibrium
monopoly and duopoly profits as a function of the size of the market S, other demand
variables and cost variables. A key observation is that the size of the market S enters
linearly into firm profits. Assuming there are only two possible entrants, firm 1 has
post-entry profits
(157) Πi(1,a2) = g(Z,β) + a2h(Z,δ) S − F(a2) − .4410 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
From this relation, Bresnahan and Reiss identify entry thresholds for a monopolist and
a duopoly. That is, the entry thresholds equal
(158) S(a2) =
F(a2) − 
g(Z,β) + a2h(Z,δ)
.
The entry thresholds are of interest because they tell us something about unobserved
fixed costs relative to the variable profit parameters. While in principle, Bresnahan and
Reiss should motivate the functions h(Z,δ) and g(Z,β) from a specific model of de-
mand and variable costs, in their empirical work they assume that these functions are
linear in the Z variables (or constants). Bresnahan and Reiss make these assumptions
both to simplify estimation and because they cannot easily separate cost and demand
variables.
In most of their work, Bresnahan and Reiss focus on estimating ratios of entry thresh-
olds. In their model, the ratio of the monopoly to the duopoly entry threshold equals:
(159)
S(1)
S(0)
=
F(1)
F(0)
g(Z,β)
g(Z,β) + h(Z,δ)
.
This expression shows that the ratio depends on the extent to which the second entrant
has higher fixed costs than if it were a monopolist and the extent to which duopoly
profits are less than monopoly profits (here h(Z,δ) < 0). Bresnahan and Reiss esti-
mate the left-hand side by first estimating the parameters of the profit functions (150)
and then forming the ratio (159). They then draw inferences about competition based
on maintained demand and cost assumptions, much as we have discussed above. For
example, they observe that entry threshold ratios in several different product markets
are not dramatically different from that implied by a model where firms act as Cournot
competitors. Again, however, their inferences about product market competition rest
heavily on their assumptions about demand and costs, and they only explore a limited
set of alternative demand and cost assumptions.
10.6. Epilogue
In Section 4 we stated that a structural modeling exercise should not go forward with-
out a clear justification, in terms of economically meaningful magnitudes that can be
estimated, for the many untestable assumptions necessary to specify and estimate a
structural model. In this case, the justification for the structural model is its ability to
recover estimates of the entry thresholds and the fixed costs of entry from the num-
ber of firms in a market. Neither of these magnitudes are directly observable and thus
can be inferred after the researcher has made assumptions about the form of demand
and firm-level costs, including entry costs. In contrast to the literature described in Sec-
tions 5 through 7 that uses market prices and quantities, with fewer observable market
outcomes,thesemodelsrelymoreheavilyonfunctionalformanddistributionalassump-
tions to recover magnitudes of economic interest.Ch. 64: Structural Econometric Modeling 4411
A number of researchers have extended Bresnahan and Reiss’ models and explored
alternatives[see Berry and Reiss (in press)]. In many respects these models share a com-
mon feature: to draw economic inferences from qualitative data on entry and exit, they
have to impose considerable economic structure and in many cases sacrifice realism
to obtain empirically tractable specifications. So what does this say about IO econo-
mists’ progress in developing structural models of oligopolistic market structure? The
bad news is that the underlying economics can make the empirical models extremely
complex. The good news is that the attempts so far have begun to define the issues that
need to be addressed. They also have clarified why simple probit models and the like
are inadequate for modeling entry and exit decisions.
11. Ending remarks
More than fifty years ago, members of the Cowles Commission began a push to esti-
mate empirical models that combined economic models with probability models. They
labeled this enterprise econometrics. In the intervening years, some economists have
come to think of econometrics as high-tech statistics applied to economic data. That
is, that econometrics is a field that mainly focuses on the development of statistical
techniques. While this may be true of some of econometrics, much of the Cowles
Commission’s original vision is alive and well. In this chapter, we have tried to pro-
vide a sense of how structural modeling proceeds in industrial organization. We used
“structural econometric modeling” as opposed to “econometric modeling” in our title
to emphasize that an application’s setting and economics should motivate specific prob-
ability models and estimation strategies, and not the other way around.
We began by comparing nonstructural or descriptive, and structural models. We
should emphasize once more that we see great value in both descriptive and structural
models. IO economists, for example, have learned much about the sources of compe-
tition from case studies of competition in specific industries. Our introductory sections
tried to provide a sense of the benefits and costs associated with developing and estimat-
ing descriptive and structural models. An important benefit of a structural model is that
it allows the researcher to make clear how economics affects the conditional distribution
of the data. For example, we can always regress market quantity on price, but this does
not necessarily mean we have estimated the parameters of a market demand function.
To know whether we have or have not, we need to be clear about supply and the sources
of error in the estimating equation.
While economic theory can help guide the specification and estimation of economic
quantities,thereisnosimplerecipefordevelopingstructuraleconometricmodels.There
are a variety of factors that make structural modeling difficult. First, economic theories
oftenaresufficientlycomplexthatitisdifficulttotranslatethemintoestimablerelations.
In this case, structural modelers who opt to estimate simpler models often are subject
to the criticism that their models are too naive to inform the theory. Second, structural
modelers often lack data on all of the constructs or quantities in an economic theory.4412 P.C. Reiss and F.A. Wolak
The absence of relevant data can considerably complicate estimation and limit what
it is that the researcher can estimate with the available data. Third, economic theory
rarely delivers all that the structural modeler needs to estimate a model. Much is left to
the modeler’s discretion. The structural modeler typically must pick: functional forms;
decide how to measure theoretical constructs; decide whether to include and how to in-
clude variables not explicitly part of the theory; how to introduce errors into the model;
and decide on the properties of errors. Each of these decisions involve judgments that
cannot be tested. Thus, these maintained assumptions need to be kept in mind when
interpreting structural model estimates, parameter tests and performing counterfactual
calculations.
In our selective tour, we have tried to provide a sense of how IO researchers have
dealt with some of these issues. Our intent was not to be a comprehensive review of all
that has been done on a particular topic, but rather to provide a vision for some of the
general modeling issues IO researchers face in linking IO theories to data. We hope that
our chapter has conveyed a sense of progress, and also a sense that much remains for
IO economists to explore.
