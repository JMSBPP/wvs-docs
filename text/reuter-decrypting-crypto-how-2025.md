ABSTRACT: This paper presents a novel methodology—leveraging a combination of AI and machine learning
to estimate the geographic distribution of international stablecoin flows, overcoming the “anonymity” of crypto
assets. Analyzing 2024 stablecoin transactions totaling $2 trillion, our findings show: (i) stablecoin flows are
highest in North America ($633bn) and in Asia and Pacific ($519bn). (ii) Relative to GDP, they are most significant
in Latin America and the Caribbean (7.7%), and in Africa and the Middle East (6.7%). (iii) North America exhibits
net outflows of stablecoins, with evidence suggesting these flows meet global dollar demand, increasing during
periods of dollar appreciation against other currencies. Further, we show that the 2023 banking crisis significantly
impeded stablecoin flows originating from North America; and finally, offer a comprehensive comparison of our
data to the Chainalysis dataset.

Decrypting Crypto: How to
Estimate International Stablecoin
Flows
Prepared by Marco Reuter1 Introduction
Policymakers are increasingly wary of the popularity of crypto assets and have called for
better monitoring of crypto transactions and international crypto asset flows (BIS (2023),
EU (2023), G7 (2023) , FATF (2023), FSB (2023), IMF (2023), US Treasury (2023)). At the
same time, recent research shows that crypto assets are increasingly used for international
transactions, particularly when capital flow measures make it diﬀicult to use traditional
channels (von Luckner et al. (2023), von Luckner et al. (2024)), and that they could poten-
tially be sizable (Cardozo et al. (2024), Cerutti et al. (2024), Auer et al. (2025)). However,
estimating international crypto asset flows remains challenging due to the opaque nature of
crypto assets.
The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel method that enables
the identification of the geographic regional origin of crypto wallets, facilitating the measure-
ment of international stablecoin flows.1
Before detailing our method, we address a common
misconception—contrary to popular belief, the vast majority of crypto assets do not provide
anonymity. Every transaction is publicly recorded on a freely accessible ledger known as a
blockchain. The perception of anonymity arises because blockchain data is pseudonymized;
rather than recording personal information such as names or residences, blockchains log only
the wallet addresses of senders and receivers. A wallet address, typically a long hexadecimal
string such as
'0xdFDEe1155E1dd7c01774560C6E98C41B7da945dB', does not directly reveal personal in-
formation about the user. The key challenge in mapping the geography of crypto asset flows
is supplementing blockchain data with useful information about senders and receivers. Our
methodology addresses this challenge by enabling the estimation of the geographic region of
any arbitrary self-custodial wallet2
in the Ethereum ecosystem.
To estimate the geographic region of self-custodial wallets (we assign wallets to one of
the following five regions: Africa and the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, North
America, and Latin America and the Caribbean), our methodology involves obtaining ge-
ographic information for a subset of wallets through two distinct approaches. First, we
leverage domain names assigned to wallets through systems such as the Ethereum Name
System (ENS).3
We employ a large language model (LLM) to infer linguistic and cultural
1
A stablecoin is a crypto asset with its value pegged to a fiat currency, most often the US dollar. The
most popular stablecoins are Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, boasting a combined market capitalization
exceeding $215 billion (June 2025).
2
A self-custodial wallet is a type of crypto wallet where the user has full control and responsibility over
their funds, without relying on third-party intermediaries for custody.
3
Name systems allow users to replace the long hexadecimal strings with human-readable names. A similar
system, the Domain Name System (DNS) is at the core of the internet, replacing numerical IP-addresses
1markers—such as language, script, or regional references—that suggest a wallet’s likely re-
gion. Second, we identify wallets that frequently transact with centralized exchanges (CEXs)
targeting specific regional markets, assuming that a wallet predominantly interacting with,
for example, a Latin America focused exchange is likely from that region. These two methods
provide an ad hoc regional classification for a subset of wallets, which we then use as labeled
training data to train a machine learning model for classification of arbitrary wallets.
The core of our approach lies in leveraging this training data to train a machine learning
model to recognize patterns in on-chain activity that are indicative of a wallet’s geographic
origin. We construct features capturing wallets’ behavioral and transactional characteristics,
including time-of-day activity patterns, adherence to daylight savings time, interactions with
certain centralized exchanges, and engagement with popular ERC-20 tokens and smart con-
tracts. By learning region-specific patterns the trained model can estimate the geographic
region of any arbitrary self-custodial wallet. The identifying assumption of the methodology
is, that conditional on the features we selected to train the model, wallets that are in the
training set and those outside the training set exhibit the same patterns. The methodology
then enables us to map the geographic distribution of wallets, which we can then leverage
to map international stablecoin flows.
Using this approach, we analyze almost 6 million domain names and billions of on-
chain transactions to construct the training dataset. Some examples of regions assigned by
analyzing domains names with the use of a LLM are, “pijiu” (Chinese for “beer”) which is
assigned to Asia and the Pacific, and ‫ﺍﻝﻙﻱﻡﺍﻭﻱﺍﺕ‬ (Arabic for “chemicals”) which is assigned
to Africa and Middle East. We validate these ad hoc classifications through time-of-day based
activity profile analysis. By adjusting wallet transaction timestamps to regional time zones
(e.g., UTC+8 for Asia and the Pacific, UTC-6 for North America), we observe distinct peaks
in activity during local daytime hours (e.g., 10 AM to 10 PM) and lows during nighttime,
supporting the accuracy of our regional assignments. Additionally, we document differences
in activity patterns due to daylight savings time (DST) in regions like North America (where
DST is common) and a lack of such differences in regions where DST is almost non-existent,
like Asia and the Pacific.
We then train a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree model on this dataset, which achieves
an overall accuracy of 65% in predicting geographic regions. For context, random guessing
with five regions yields 20% accuracy. We then apply the model to predict the region of
any arbitrary self-custodial wallet. Using these predictions, we map international stablecoin
flows for 2024. Our analysis captures approximately 138 million transactions totaling $2,019
billion, with an average transaction size of $14,630.
with domain names in the common “www.xyz.com” format.
2We document significant regional variation in stablecoin usage. In absolute terms, we
estimate that Asia and the Pacific lead with the highest stablecoin activity (inflows: $407bn,
outflows: $395bn, intraregional flows: $209bn), followed by North America (inflows: $363bn,
outflows: $417bn, intraregional flows: $216bn). However, relative to GDP, Africa and the
Middle East, and Latin America and the Caribbean stand out, with stablecoin usage reach-
ing 6.7% and 7.7% of GDP, respectively. Additionally, intraregional flows in these two
regions are notably lower, accounting for 14% and 12% of total flows originating from the
region, compared to, for example, 34% in North America. This suggests that stablecoin use
in Africa and Latin America is predominantly international, possibly driven by use cases
such as remittances. Further, there is also significant heterogeneity in average transaction
sizes, spanning from $11,493 (Asia and Pacific) to $35,016 (North America). Intuitively, re-
gions with higher GDP/capita (e.g., North America and Europe) exhibit the largest average
transaction sizes, while average transaction sizes in the other regions are significantly lower.
We also document regional heterogeneity in usage of different stablecoins (i.e., USDC vs
USDT) and different CEXs. Tether’s USDT is more popular in regions with more emerging
economies—Africa and the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the
Caribbean—while Circle’s USDC is more prevalent in regions with more advanced economies,
i.e., Europe and North America. Regarding crypto exchanges, we find that Binance is
preferred in emerging market regions, whereas Coinbase leads in North America.
Calculating bilateral net flows highlights North America as the primary source of sta-
blecoin outflows into all other regions of the world, which we estimate to amount to $54bn
in 2024.4
Using this observation, we validate our dataset by providing evidence that net
stablecoin flows from North America into other geographic regions increase when domestic
currencies are weak, complementing a related relationship between stablecoin flows and high
inflation established by Auer et al. (2025). Additionally—after training an additional model
to provide country-level estimates for China—we show that a similar pattern holds for sta-
blecoin flows into China. That is, they increase significantly when the US-Dollar appreciates
vis-à-vis the Chinese Renminbi. This suggests that stablecoins could increasingly be serving
as an instrument to meet global demand for dollars, particularly in regions where access
to traditional dollar markets is constrained (see e.g., Calvo and Reinhart (2002), Gopinath
and Stein (2021) for global demand on dollars, and Aramonte et al. (2022) for evidence on
stablecoin demand in emerging markets).
We further validate our dataset—and establish novel empirical evidence of the connection
between stablecoins and the banking system—by documenting how stablecoin flows were
4
These flows are likely accompanied by countervailing flows in fiat currency or goods into North America,
which we do not observe.
3disrupted during the March 2023 banking crisis. Many of the banks affected in the crisis
provided banking services to CEXs and stablecoin issuers, which are crucial for settling
the fiat currency leg in stablecoin issuance and redemption. In a differences-in-differences
regression, with North America as the treated region and the other regions a control, we
show that the crisis significantly reduced stablecoin flows originating from North America.
Finally, we also offer the first comprehensive dataset that can be compared to the com-
mercially available Chainalysis dataset, that has been extensively used in the literature (e.g.,
in Cardozo et al. (2024), Cerutti et al. (2024), Auer et al. (2025)). For context, we briefly
describe the methodology at the core of that dataset: Chainalysis infers the geographic ori-
gin and destination of stablecoin transactions by focusing on transactions involving CEXs.
To assign regions, Chainalysis uses web traﬀic data associated with CEXs. That is, they
obtain data about the number of users that access the corresponding websites of the CEX,
broken down by country. They assume that the geographic distribution of a platform’s
website visitors reflects its user base. For instance, if a significant share of a CEX’s web
traﬀic originates from Brazil, Chainalysis attributes a proportional share of that exchange’s
stablecoin transactions to Brazilian users. For identification, they assume that users do not
use VPNs5
, when accessing these websites, as VPNs are often used to misrepresent the true
country of origin. Further, this approach assumes that transaction sizes are uniform across
users, regardless of their country or region. When a stablecoin is sent from one CEX to
another, the flow is then broken down according to web-traﬀic proportions and assigned as
an in/outflow between the respective countries.
In contrast, our approach focuses on estimating the geographic region of self-custodial
wallets. For identification, we assume that conditional on the features we selected in the
machine learning model, wallets that are in the training set and those outside the training
set exhibit the same patterns. Advantages of our approach are that we do not assume that
users do not use VPNs or that users in different regions, on average, have the same transaction
size. In fact, we provide evidence that invalidates this assumption. A disadvantage of our
approach however, is the lower granularity of the estimates. While we can (largely) only
provide region-level estimates, the Chainalysis dataset provides estimates on a country-level
basis.
Comparing both datasets, we find both significant agreements and disagreements. For
example, both datasets roughly agree on the volume of stablecoin flows in 2024, with our
estimate being $2,109bn, while Chainalysis estimates $1,730bn. Differences in the over-

privacy and security.
4all quantities can be explained by differences in coverage of the underlying blockchains,
and coverage of certain transactions. They further agree that Asia and Pacific, and North
America exhibit significant flows in terms of absolute volumes, while Africa and the Middle
East, and Latin America and Caribbean lead in flows relative to GDP. On net flows, both
datasets broadly agree that stablecoins largely from from North America to the other re-
gions. However, disagreement arises with the “indirect” category in the Chainalysis data,
which estimates a reversal in the direction of flows, contradicting both our estimates and
those of the “direct” category in the Chainalysis dataset.6
Further, there is significant dis-
agreement regarding the use of stablecoins in China. For 2024, we estimate 5.5 times more
gross stablecoin flows involving China (i.e., $153bn vs $28bn) and 100 times more net flows
of stablecoins into China (i.e., $18bn vs $0.18bn). We believe that the no VPN assumption of
Chainalysis is systematically violated for China. For example, we estimate Binance to be the
most significant CEX in China, and that Binance drives $11 billion in net stablecoin inflows
to Chinese self-custodial wallets, despite its website being inaccessible without a VPN.7
Related Literature. This paper contributes in particular to the literature that focuses
on the measurement and drivers of international crypto flows, and in general to the literature
that studies the connection between crypto assets on macroeconomic variables.
In terms of methodology, the closest paper is Athey et al. (2016). They estimate the
region of self-custodial Bitcoin wallets in 2015 on a small scale by identifying the region of
2,858 addresses scraped from online forums and train a random forest model for classification,
allowing them to generate empirical evidence in support of their theoretical model on Bitcoin
adoption. Relative to their work, we contribute by (1) generating a much larger dataset
(∼350,000 wallets) by analyzing wallet domain names, which had yet to be invented in
2015; (2) leveraging this dataset to train a model that can be used to estimate the region
of any arbitrary self-custodial wallet and (3) applying the estimates to comprehensively
map international crypto asset flows. Other papers (Meiklejohn et al. (2013) and Makarov
and Schoar (2021)), have used heuristic clustering and behavior-based classification to link
wallets, but have not attempted to specifically make geographic predictions about wallets.
Recently, a literature that attempts to quantify international crypto flows and study
their drivers has emerged (Cardozo et al. (2024), Cerutti et al. (2024), Auer et al. (2025)),
that has leveraged the dataset by Chainalysis as the basis for their analysis. Relative to

Chainalysis splits flows into direct flows, which flow directly from CEX to CEX, and indirect flows,
which they attempt to trace while passing through self-custodial wallets en route between CEXs. For a more
detailed explanation, see https://docs.markets.chainalysis.com/#flow-categories.

Coincidentally, Binance hosts a blog post on how to use Binance via VPN from China (https://www.
binance.com/en/square/post/17293683766001).
5these papers, we contribute by introducing a novel methodology to estimate international
crypto flows that does not rely on the Chainalysis dataset and its assumptions (no VPN
usage, same transaction size in every country), by producing the first dataset that allows for
a comprehensive comparison to the Chainalysis data, and by outlining some novel drivers
of stablecoin flows, such as exchange rates and the March 2023 banking crisis.8
Other
papers, such as, von Luckner et al. (2023) and von Luckner et al. (2024) have focused on
providing qualitative evidence that crypto assets are used for circumventing capital controls
and to facilitate capital flight. Relative to these, we contribute by providing quantitative
estimates. Further, von Luckner et al. (2023) had to exclude dollar denominated flows from
their analysis of peer-to-peer transactions for identification, which we specifically focus on
by analyzing stablecoins.
Our paper also connects to a wider literature, linking macroeconomic conditions and
crypto usage more generally. For example, Cong et al. (2023) provide evidence that house-
holds adopt crypto assets and stablecoins when they expect higher inflation. Our data indi-
rectly supports this finding by showing that stablecoin usage in regions with more emerging
economies is relatively higher as a fraction of GDP. Alnasaa et al. (2022) show that crypto
usage is positively correlated with perceived corruption and capital controls, while Arbalik
et al. (2021) document correlation between Bitcoin volatility and capital flows. Focusing on
China, Hu et al. (2021) find evidence of capital flight through Bitcoin in China, a finding
that our country-specific analysis on China supports, extends to stablecoins, and is able to
quantify.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides some background infor-
mation about international stablecoin flows, section 3 provides an overview of the data used,
section 4 explains the methodology used, section 5 explains the results of the classification
model, section 6 maps international stablecoin flows, section 7 analyzes economic drivers of
stablecoin flows, and section 8 compares our dataset with the Chainalysis dataset.
## 2 Background
In this section, we offer background information about how international crypto flows operate
in practice. For that, we break down the typical transaction chain, identifying which legs
of the transaction are observable in our data. Figure 1 provides a schematic overview that
summarizes how international crypto flows work in practice. Typically, the initial step in any
international crypto flow involves exchanging fiat currency for a crypto asset. The dominant

wake of the crisis.
6channel for this is the use of centralized exchanges (CEXs) such as Binance or Coinbase.
Users transfer fiat currency to a CEX, which then facilitates the conversion into a crypto
asset—for example a stablecoin like Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC—either by acting as
the counterparty or by matching the user with another user in a peer-to-peer transaction.
These initial transfers of money to the CEX occur within the traditional fiat banking system,
and therefore, we do not observe them in our data.
Once a user acquires a stablecoin, they may engage in different activities. For example,
they could send the stablecoin to another user on the same CEX. As the stablecoin remains
within the same CEX, no on-chain transaction takes place and we do not observe such
transactions in our data. Arguably, this is a traditional fiat-based capital flow facilitated by
the CEX and not a crypto capital flow. Another possibility is that the user transfers the
stablecoin from one CEX to another CEX (and from there, exchanges for fiat and possibly
withdraws into a bank account). The transfer of assets between CEXes is recorded on-chain
and thus observable. Further, the user might withdraw the stablecoin to a self-custodial
wallet for use in another region, which is also observable; or the user could withdraw the
stablecoin to a self-custodial wallet and subsequently send it to another self-custodial wallet
or CEX, which is recorded on-chain and thus observable.
Figure 1: Schematic Overview of International Crypto Flows
Finally, the CEX that has received the fiat money and exchanged it for a stablecoin, has
7to decide what to do with the fiat money. They could decide to hold on to the fiat money,
or to exchange it for another currency (e.g., back into dollars) and tranfer it internationally
through the traditional financial system. None of this is observable in our data.
## 3 Data
Blockchain data. We obtained full copies of the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Op-
timism, Arbitrum, Base and Linea blockchains by synchronizing a node with the respective
network and extracted the data using the Ethereum ETL package for Python (Medvedev
and the D5 team (2018)). For every blockchain, the data spans the period from the gene-
sis block9
until the last block that has been recorded in 2024. This provides us with data
spanning from July 30th 2015, when Ethereum began operating, until December 31st 2024,
with other blockchains joining throughout the sample period. The data is transaction level
data, exceeding 12 billion transactions and more than 20 terabytes of storage. A transaction
occurs when a wallet interacts with the blockchain, such as when transferring crypto assets
or interacting with smart contracts.10
This data also includes all transfers of stablecoins,
which we use to map stablecoin flows after estimating the geographic region of wallets.
Further, we combine the transaction level data from the different blockchains in our
sample using the fact that wallet addresses carry over between different EVM-compatible11
blockchains. That is, if we observe that the same wallet address executed transactions on
different blockchains, we can be certain that those have been initiated by the same user.
This allows us to track the same wallet throughout the whole data set, no matter the spe-
cific blockchain a transaction took place on.
Domain name data. A wallet address–for the blockchains in our sample–is a 42-character
hexadecimal string that starts with ‘0x’, such as '0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D
37aA96045'. Because these strings are cumbersome to handle, domain name systems have
been developed that allow users to effectively replace these strings with human-readable
domain names, such as ‘vitalik.eth’.12
Users can purchase these domain names from service
providers, with the most popular being the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). Purchase prices
for these domains typically range from single to triple digit dollar amounts. These purchases
are recorded as on-chain transactions and thus data for all purchases is public. For simplic-
9
The genesis block refers to the first block of a blockchain.
10
Technically speaking, a transaction is issued by a wallet whenever a user wants to change the state of
the blockchain. A transaction can, but does not necessarily have to, include the transfer of assets.
11
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a virtual machine for executing code that has been adopted
by other blockchains to guarantee compatibility.
12
vitalik.eth is an ENS domain owned by Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum.
8ity, we obtain our domain name data through queries in Dune Analytics.13
Supplementary data from Dune Analytics. We also obtain some further supplemen-
tary data from Dune Analytics. First is a list of wallets that belong to centralized exchanges
such as Binance or Coinbase, totaling 10,072 wallets among 333 entities. Using this data,
we identify further wallets belonging to exchanges in a procedure described in appendix C.
Second, we obtain a list of wallets that belong to certain types of bots (i.e. MEV bots).
We exclude these wallets because our method would likely mispredict their geographic lo-
cation, as they are systematically different from the wallets in the training data set that
we build. Third, is data on smart contracts for the different blockchains, including the
contract addresses and a categorization of the type of contract (e.g., NFTs or decentralized
exchanges), and finally, we use data on different stablecoins (e.g., their contract addresses)
on different blockchains.

even though Ethereum is the longest running blockchain in the sample, it has produced less

## 4 Methodology for estimating the geographic region of
self-custodial wallets
We divide the world into five regions: Africa and the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific,
Europe, North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. To estimate the geographic
region of self-custodial wallets, our methodology involves obtaining geographic information
for a subset of wallets through two distinct approaches. First, we leverage domain names as-
signed to wallets purchased through systems such as the Ethereum Name System (ENS). We
employ a LLM to infer linguistic and cultural markers—such as language, script, or regional
references—that suggest a wallet’s likely region. Second, we identify wallets that frequently
transact with centralized exchanges targeting specific regional markets, assuming that a wal-
let predominantly interacting with, for example, a Latin American-focused exchange is likely
from that region. These two methods provide an ad hoc regional classification for a subset
of wallets, which we then use as labeled training data to train a machine learning model for
classification of arbitrary wallets.
Specifically, we train a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (for background on the method
see e.g., Hastie et al. (2017)) leveraging the Yggdrasil Decision Forests (YDF) library in
Python (Guillame-Bert et al. (2023)) to classify the region of a wallet by recognizing patterns
that are characteristic for the respective regions. For this, we construct features capturing
wallets’ behavioral and transactional characteristics, including time-of-day activity patterns,
(non)adherence to daylight savings time, interactions with certain centralized exchanges, and
engagement with popular ERC-20 tokens and smart contracts. By learning region-specific
10patterns the trained model can estimate the geographic region of any arbitrary self-custodial
wallet.
## 4.1 Generating training data
## 4.1.1 By analyzing domain names
A significant advantage of using a large language model for inferring the region, country, or
language of Ethereum Name System domains is its ability to scale, as it can analyze millions
of domains quickly and eﬀiciently. Moreover, ENS supports Unicode Technical Standard 51,
which allows users to register domains that employ a diverse range of characters—including
those from Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese scripts, and even emojis. This facilitates clas-
sification of domain names by providing clear linguistic markers. In some cases, inferring the
region can be more straightforward than pinpointing a specific country, as demonstrated by
instances where regional characteristics are more pronounced than national ones. However,
while making inferences about a country’s identity can work particularly well for nations
with distinct scripts and large populations—such as China—it tends to be less reliable for
smaller countries and countries where linguistic markers may not be as clear-cut.
Despite these advantages, several limitations warrant consideration. One notable chal-
lenge is that users might reside in one region while choosing a name that is culturally or
linguistically associated with another. For instance, users around the world may select En-
glish names or incorporate references to U.S. culture, even if they are not based in the United
States. Similarly, migrant populations in Europe or the U.S. might opt for domain names
that evoke their country of origin rather than their current locale. Additionally, LLMs can
sometimes misinterpret inputs or exhibit biases—for example, when processing German do-
main names, it may default to associating them with Germany rather than recognizing that
they might equally belong to Austria or Switzerland.
For every domain name in our sample, we query the LLM and instruct it to analyze the
domain name and guess the country, language, and region the user is from and to provide a
short reason for the classification. In essence, our prompt reads:15
“You are trained to classify ENS domain names by country, language, region,
and provide a short reason for the classification. Consider references to culture,
language, localities, memes. Be creative. Be mindful of the language commonly
used in crypto and web3; and of languages that are spoken in many parts of the

11world, such as English, French and Spanish. If you cannot classify any of these,
output ‘unclassified’ for that particular attribute. Classify the domain: {domain
name}.”
We restrict the maximum number of tokens of the reply to 150 and set the temperature
and “top_p” to 0.4 each. A reply of 150 tokens equals roughly 110-120 words in the English
language, while setting the LLM’s temperature and top_p to 0.4 makes its responses more
deterministic and focused by reducing randomness (temperature) and narrowing the range
of token probabilities considered (top_p), leading to safer and more predictable outputs.
Some wallets have more than one domain name registered to them. In these cases, we assign
the region as the region that was assigned by the majority of the LLM’s guesses, excluding
“unclassified” responses. That is, a wallet which owns 10 domains, 6 of which have been
left unclassified, 3 assigned to Europe and 1 assigned to North America will be assigned to
Europe.16
## 4.1.2 By linking wallets to regional exchanges
Some centralized exchanges focus on particular markets that often are restricted to a region
or a country. For example, the exchange “Indodax” markets itself as an “Indonesian Bitcoin
and Crypto Exchange” and its website is written entirely in Indonesian. We exploit this fact
to classify wallets as belonging to a particular region, if they interact particularly frequently
with exchanges that focus on that region. The idea is that a self-custodial wallet that
frequently receives or sends money to an exchange that is focused on a regional market is
likely to belong to a user from that region. Table 12 in the appendix provides a comprehensive
list of all exchanges that we classify as particularly regional. We classify a self-custodial wallet
as belonging to a particular region, if more than 90% of its transactions with centralized
exchanges are with centralized exchanges of that particular region.
## 4.2 Training the classification model
To achieve our goal of estimating the geographic region for any self-custodial wallet, we
take the regional classification through domain names and regionally focused centralized
exchanges at face value and use them as training data to develop a model that recognizes
patterns that are predictive of what region a self-custodial wallet is from. To ensure that
we have enough observations on a per wallet basis to reliably recognize patterns, we restrict
16
Crypto wallets can own multiple domains, similar to how different domain names can lead to the same
website. For example, www.coca-cola.com, www.cocacola.com and www.coke.com all lead to the same
website.
12the sample to only include wallets that have initiated at least 50 transactions. We use the
following features to train the classification model:
Time of Day Features. For every wallet, we calculate the percentage of transactions
that are conducted within every hour of the day. To condense the data and avoid potential
overfitting issues, we then estimate a third degree polynomial describing the activity profile
and use the coeﬀicients as features.17
Daylight Savings Time Features. For every wallet, we calculate its activity profile during
the months of daylight savings time and during the remainder of the year. This feature
exploits regional heterogeneity in the use of daylight savings time. While DST is common
in Europe and North America, it is not common in many other regions and non-existent in
Asia.
Top 5 Centralized Exchanges. For every wallet, we count the number of transactions
with a centralized exchange (i.e., withdrawals and deposits). We then sort descending by
exchange name and create a categorical variable for the most used centralized exchange,
second most used centralized exchange, and so on.
Top 10 ERC-20 Tokens and Smart Contract Namespaces. These are two similar features.
For the top 10 ERC-20 tokens, we count, for every wallet, the number of transactions using
ERC-20 contracts, sort them descending by count and create a categorical variables for
the top 10 most used ERC-20 contracts. For smart contracts in general, we count, for every
wallet, the number of transactions with smart contracts of the same “namespace”18
, sort them
in descending order by count and create categorical variables for the top 10 most interacted
namespaces. While the first feature offers some more granularity exploiting heterogeneity
on the ERC-20 level, the second feature groups smart contracts based on functionalities and
exploits heterogeneity along this dimension.
Training and Evaluation. To train and evaluate the model, we split the data into a
training data set (90% of the data) and a testing data set (10% of the data). We then train
3 models that we combine to estimate the likely region from the set {Africa and Middle East,
Asia and Pacific, Europe, Latin America and Caribbean, North America} that the wallet
belongs to. The process is illustrated by the following decision tree:
17
We use a third degree polynomial to be able to accompany both a minimum and a maximum in the
activity profile
18
The “namespace” groups smart contracts that offer similar functionalities as provided by Dune Analytics.
13Figure 2: Decision Tree Structure of Classification Models
That is, we first train a model that assigns one of the following three classifications to
an address: {North America, Latin America and Carribbean} or {Africa and Middle East,
Europe} or Asia and Pacific. Instead of immediately assigning North America, or Latin
America and Caribbean, the model assigns the classification that the wallet could be in
either region. This approach maximizes the usefulness of the time of day based features,
as the grouped regions largely share the same time zones. We then proceed to train two
more models. One that splits {North America, Latin America and Carribbean} into its
respective regions and one that splits {Africa and Middle East, Europe} into its respective
regions. These further models then largely exploit the other features to distinguish between
the respective regions. For each of the three models trained, the YDF package automatically
splits off some of the data for validation to avoid over fitting any given model. To address
imbalance in the training data, we calculate balanced sample weights–that is, each observa-
tion is weighted inversely proportional to its class frequency–ensuring that underrepresented
classes contribute equally to the estimation process (see e.g., King and Zeng (2001), He and
Garcia (2009)).
Classification of Arbitrary Self-Custodial Wallets. To classify arbitrary self-custodial
wallets, we calculate the same features that are used in training the model for wallets that
have not been part of the training data and restrict the sample to only include wallets that
have at least 50 transactions, to align with the restriction we made in training the model.
We then apply the trained model to predict the most likely region the wallet belongs to.
14Our key identifying assumption is that, conditional on the features used to train the model,
wallets of a particular region in the subset that was used to train the model follow the same
data generating process as the wallets out of sample that the model is used on to predict
regions. For example, we assume that there is no systematic difference between a North
American wallet in the subset used to train the model and an out of sample North American
wallet with respect to the hours of the day during which they are typically active.
## 5 Results
## 5.1 Training Data
## 5.1.1 Domain Names
Before providing summary statistics of the results, we provide some example classifications
of domain names by the LLM to allow the reader to better evaluate the validity of the
approach. In Table 3, we present one example for each of the possible regions. The possible
region outputs are “unclassified”, when the LLM does not find suﬀicient evidence to assign the
domain to a particular region; and “Africa and Middle East”, “Asia and Pacific”, “Europe”,
“Latin America and Caribbean”, and “North America”.
Of course, there is no guarantee that any given guess that the LLM makes is in fact true.
Thus, before we use the output of the LLM as input for the training data, we proceed to
validate whether this methodology produces reasonable training data. For validation, we
collect the timestamps of every single transaction of the wallets that the LLM has classified
from our blockchain data. Then, for each wallet, we calculate an activity profile by counting
the number of transactions executed within each hour of the day and normalizing by the
total number of transactions to derive the % of transactions that have occurred within a
particular hour. We then aggregate these wallet-specific activity profiles by region. Since all
timestamps in the data are recorded in UTC time, we offset the timestamps for the different
regions to convert them to regional timestamps.
For Africa and the Middle East, we use use UTC+2, corresponding to the Central African
time zone; for Asia and Pacific, we use UTC+8, corresponding to the time zone that is cen-
tered on China, parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Western Australia; for Europe
we use UTC+2, which corresponds to Central European Summer Time; for Latin America
and Caribbean we use UTC-4, centering on parts of Brazil, Chile and Venezuela; and for
North America, we use UTC-6, which corresponds to Central Time in the US. Our intention
behind choosing these time zones is not to take a stance on which time zone is the most
appropriate to capture an entire region that spans multiple different time zones, but to off-

vucoworld unclassified unclassified unclassified
Reason: The term ‘vucoworld’ does not clearly reference a specific country, lan-
guage, or region. It appears to be a coined term possibly related to virtual or digital
worlds, which are universal concepts in the crypto and web3 space.
‫ﺍﻝﻙﻱﻡﺍﻭﻱﺍﺕ‬ Africa and Middle East unclassified Arabic
Reason: The domain name is in Arabic, which is widely spoken in the Middle East
and North Africa, and it translates to ‘chemicals’, indicating a potential relevance
to industries in those regions.
pijiu Asia and Pacific China Chinese
Reason: ‘Pijiu’ means ‘beer’ in Chinese, reflecting a popular beverage in Chinese
culture.
philippzinner Europe Germany German
Reason: The name ‘philippzinner’ suggests a German origin, likely a personal
name, which is common in Germany and associated with the German language.
laplazart Latin America and Caribbean Mexico Spanish
Reason: The name ‘laplazart’ suggests a connection to ‘La Plaza’, which is Spanish
for ’The Square’, a common term in many Latin American countries, particularly
in Mexico, where plazas are central to community life and culture.

Reason: The term ‘lakings’ likely refers to the Los Angeles Kings, a professional
ice hockey team based in Los Angeles, California, which is a significant part of
American sports culture.

set the UTC based timestamps by a reasonable amount as such to convert UTC time to a
reasonable proxy of “local time” for the different regions, balancing out parts of the region
that are further ahead or further behind the specific choice of time zone. We then plot the

Figure 3: Activity Profiles for Wallets in the Training Data
16The activity pattern of all regions in the graph exhibits a distinctive dip in activity during
the nighttime, which is intuitive, as we would expect activity to be lower when most people
are sleeping. Further, the times of the highest activity span from roughly 10 AM to 10 PM,
which correspond to times of the day where most people would be awake. Our interpretation
of the figure is that it is supporting evidence that the classification of domain names by the
LLM, on aggregate, is successful in assigning the correct regions based on the domain names.
## 5.1.2 Regional Exchange Users
We validate our methodology for identifying wallets that interact with regionally focused
CEXs using the same activity profile idea that has been outlined in the section on domain
names above. The corresponding activity profiles are depicted in Figure 3b. To offer some
further validation of our methodology in creating the training data (both through domain
names and regional exchange users), we provide Figure 4 below, that shows that it is also
possible to detect the effect of daylight savings time in the classified wallets.
(a) North America (b) Asia and Pacific
Figure 4: Comparison of the Impact of Daylight Savings Time Across Regions
In the left hand side figure, we plot the activity patterns of wallets that we have identified
to be from North America. We fix the x-axis to correspond to the typically assigned time
zone for the region (e.g. UTC-6 for North America). Then, we split the data into the time
period from March to October, which corresponds to Standard Time in the United States,
and the time from November to February, which corresponds to Daylight Saving Time in
the United States. The figure clearly shows, that the activity profile in the United States is
offset by roughly one hour, as one would expect due to the one hour shift due to Daylight
Saving Time. In contrast, the figure on the right hand side shows that there is no significant
difference in activity by time of day for the wallets that we have classified to be from Asia
17and Pacific. This is to be expected, as, with the exception of Australia and New Zealand,
no countries in Asia and Pacific observe daylight savings time. We see this as further strong
supporting evidence that the classification of wallets in our training data is, on average,
correct. Further figures for the other regions can be found in appendix B.
Finally, we present summary statistics of the training data that is generated by our
methodology in Table 4. In total, our methodology succeeds in identifying the region of
346,201 wallets, with three quarters being identified through domain names and one quarter
through usage of regional CEXs. For domain names, we are able to identify 260,655 wallets
out of almost 6 million, that is, roughly 4.4%. While some wallets do carry geographic infor-
mation in their names, most do not. However, in absolute terms, we succeed in identifying a
sizable number of wallets for our training dataset. About half the identified wallets originate
from Asia, with the smallest number of identified wallets originating from Latin America and
Caribbean. That said, we do not believe that these proportions are necessarily representative
of crypto wallets as a whole. Instead, some regions might be easier to identify, for example,
due to distinct languages. To account for this imbalance in training the classification model,
we employ balanced sample weights as discussed in section 4.2.

Table 4: Overview of Training Data
## 5.1.3 Classification Model
After using the training data to train the gradient boosted decision tree classification model,
we evaluate the model on the secluded testing data. To describe its performance, we first
discuss the confusion matrix in Figure 5 below. It displays the true region of the testing data
in the rows and the predicted region of the model in the columns. The data in the matrix
has been normalized, such that all rows add up to 100%.
18Figure 5: Confusion Matrix of Classification Model
To help interpret the matrix, it is useful to think of some special cases. A model that
perfectly classifies the regions would display 100% along its main diagonal, and all off-
diagonal entries would be 0. A model that uniformly guesses at random would display 20%
in all cells of the confusion matrix. Keeping this in mind, we can see that the model has
significant predictive power, performing best in predicting Asia and Pacific (69.8%) and
worst at predicting Africa and the Middle East (45.8%). While clearly not perfect, even the
predictions for the worst performing region are still significantly better than random guesses.
A good performance in prediction indicates two things. First, users in the respective region
have relatively distinctive on-chain behavior that the classification model can recognize and
use for prediction. Second, it is indicative about the performance of the LLM in classifying
the underlying domain names correctly.
To dig further into the model performance, we discuss some of the errors in prediction
regions, i.e., the off-diagonal elements of the matrix. If the model makes random errors off-
diagonal elements should be symmetric. That is, the proportion of domains from region X
that were incorrectly classified as region Y should be equal to the proportion of misclassified
domains from region Y as region X. Examining the off-diagonal entries of the confusion
matrix, we can see that errors do largely appear to not be random. First, there is a tendency
for wallets to be more likely to be misclassified as being in Asia and Pacific, and in Europe.
This likely stems from the fact that those two regions contain the majority of observations
in the training data, and is a type of bias that we try to avoid by using balanced sample
19weights. Second, there is a tendency of the model to “misclassify” domains in a fashion that
potentially undoes misclassification of the region by the LLM when generating the training
data (hence the quotation marks around “misclassify”). To explain this intuitively, note
that for example, the proportion of wallets with the true region Africa and Middle East
that is classified as North America (11.8%) far exceeds the proportion of wallets with the
true region North America that is classified as Africa and Middle East (3.6%). We think
that this likely reflects the fact that there is a sizable immigrant population from Africa
and the Middle East in North America (who may have chosen domain names that reflect
their heritage), which is correctly recognized by the classification model. In contrast, there
is not a significant immigrant population from North America that resides in Africa and
the Middle East. Therefore, these “misclassifications” of the model are a desirable bias that
potentially undoes some incorrect classifications by the LLM when generating the training
data. A similar observation can be made for misclassifications of Latin America and North
America; and for misclassifications of Africa and Latin America vis-a-vis Europe. With
respect to misclassifications of Asia and Pacific, a region that also likely has a significant
number of emigration to Europe and North America, we observe that errors are much more
symmetric. This is likely due to the fact that the misclassifications towards Asia and Pacific,
which stem from it being a majority class, are somewhat balanced by the countervailing bias
due to immigration flows.
In appendix D, we provide further details (ROC, AUC, a variety of graphs) about the
performance of the three individual classification models that are used.
## 5.2 Estimating the Region of Arbitrary Self-Custodial Wallets
To estimate stablecoin flows, we utilize the predicted probabilities for each region generated
by the classification model, rather than relying solely on the most likely predicted region.
Incorporating the full distribution of predictions enhances the accuracy and stability of the
results. To provide an overview of the total number of self-custodial wallets for which we
provide a geographic prediction, we aggregate the regional probabilities. The results are
given in Table 5. In total, we have identified 20 million self-custodial wallets that transfer
stablecoins on the blockchains included in our sample. We estimate that most wallets belong
to Asia and Pacific, with the second most being located in North America. The other three
regions have fairly comparable numbers of users. Finally, we manually assigned a handful of
wallets that belong to notable entities, as outlined in appendix E.

## 6 Estimating International Stablecoin Flows
While our data covers the timeframe from the inception of stablecoins up until the end of
2024, we focus on presenting the data for 2024 in this section. First, we present some sum-
mary statistics for stablecoin flows in 2024, before showing detailed breakdowns of stablecoin
flows in the following subsections. The total number of stablecoin transactions that we map
is around 138 million, totalling a volume of $2,019 billion, implying an average transaction
size of $14,630.19
The total number of wallets involved in these transactions is 14.6 mil-
lion, which can be subdivided into 10.4 million that belong to centralized exchanges and
4.2 million self-custodial wallets. The total volume of $2,019 billion can be split into three
categories: $309bn in flows entirely between self-custodial wallets, $1,141bn in flows between
self-custodial wallets and centralized exchanges and $569bn in flows between centralized ex-
changes. This breakdown highlights the importance of determining the geographic region
of self-custodial wallets, as they are present in at least one side of the transaction in 72%
stablecoin transactions as measured by volume. There is considerable heterogeneity in the
regional useage of the different stablecoins, as outlined in Table 6 below.
As shown in the table, USDT is more popular in regions that feature more emerging
markets (i.e., Africa and Middle East, Asia and Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean),
while USDC is more popular in regions that feature more advances economies (Europe,
North America). There is also considerable heterogeneity in the average size of transactions.
Intuitively, transaction sizes in regions that are more economically developed also tend to
be larger (cf. Table 7) That is, North America has the largest average transaction size at
$35,016, with the smallest occurring in Asia and Pacific ($11,493). Further, stablecoin flows
exhibit fat tails, with averages significantly exceeding the median.20
19
We exclude stablecoin transactions where the sender and receiver is the same centralized exchange, as
these are typically due to operational needs. That is, they are flows from deposit addresses to hot wallets
and flows between hot wallets and cold storage wallets.
20
We exclude stablecoin flows with values less than 1 cent in the calculations to avoid skewing them due
to so called “dusting attacks”.

Further, we present regional heterogeneity in the preference for interacting with Binance
and Coinbase, as outlined in Table 8. The popularity of Binance and Coinbase across regions
follows a similar trend to the popularity of USDT and USDC across regions. That is,
regions with more emerging markets tend to favor interactions with Binance, while Coinbase’s
popularity increases in regions with more advanced economies.

## 6.1 Stablecoin Flows Between Self-Custodial Wallets
This section focuses on the description of stablecoin flows between self-custodial wallets
of different geographic regions. In Figure 6, we present our estimates of both gross and
(bilateral) net flows of stablecoins in 2024 between regions.
22(a) Regional Stablecoin Gross Flows (b) Regional Stablecoin Net Flows
Figure 6: Regional Stablecoin Gross and Net Flows
(in billion dollars)
We begin with the figure displaying gross flows on the left hand side. For each region, we
split flows into three categories. Inflows, outflows and within flows (where both the sender
and receiver are in the same region). The largest regions in terms of stablecoin flows are Asia
and Pacific ($156.28 bn), followed by North America ($118.26 bn), while Latin America and
Caribbean has the smallest stablecoin flows ($66.39 bn). However, relative to GDP, both
Africa and Middle East (1.5%) and Latin America and Caribbean (1.4%) exhibit significantly
higher stablecoin flows than the other regions (Asia and Pacific: 0.4% , Europe 0.4%, North
America: 0.4% ), hinting at the popularity of stablecoins and crypto assets, particularly
in emerging markets, that has been described in the literature (see e.g., von Luckner et al.
(2023), Cardozo et al. (2024), Cerutti et al. (2024)).21
As a general pattern, within region flows are sizably smaller than between region flows.
This is in line with the idea that stablecoins are particularly attractive for international
payments and remittances, an area in which traditional transfers are particularly slow and
costly (see e.g., World Bank (2024)). In contrast, within region (and in particular, within
country) payments are typically significantly more eﬀicient than their international coun-
terparts, making stablecoins less attractive as an instrument to conduct such payments.
Further, within country payments are also more likely to be denominated in local currency

23rather then dollars, contributing to limited utility of stablecoins for domestic payments in
economies that are not dollarized. Finally, on net flows, virtually all stablecoin net flows are
outflows from North American wallets ($21.54 bn) to the other regions.
## 6.2 Stablecoin Flows Between Centralized Exchanges and Self-
Custodial Wallets
In this section, we describe stablecoin transfers between self-custodial wallets and centralized
exchanges. Centralized exchanges take a pivotal role in the crypto ecosystem, as they offer
the most prominent venues for users to exchange fiat currencies and crypto assets. That
is, when a user wants to buy a crypto asset with fiat currency, typically the transaction is
intermediated by a centralized exchange. Similarly, when a user wants to sell a crypto asset
for fiat currency, the transaction is typically intermediated by a centralized exchange.
In Figure 7, we present our estimate of stablecoin flows between centralized exchanges
and the geographic regions. For centralized exchanges, we separately depict Binance and
(a) Gross Flows (b) Net Flows
Figure 7: Stablecoin Flows between Self-Custodial Wallets and Centralized Exchanges (in
billion dollars)
Coinbase as the two individual exchanges that are involved in the largest amount of flows.
All other exchanges are grouped into the “Other CEX” category. In terms of volumes,
the critical role of centralized exchanges in bridging the fiat and crypto system becomes
apparent. Binance alone processes more volume than any single geographic region of self-
custodial wallets. As a general pattern, Binance and the Other CEX facilitate the vast
24majority of inflows of stablecoins into self-custodial wallets for all geographic regions. In
contrast, Coinbase receives far more inflows of stablecoins from self-custodial wallets than
outflows. This pattern hints at the possibility that Binance and other exchanges typically
facilitate “on-ramping”, that is the exchange of fiat currency for stablecoins, some of which
are then further transferred into self-custodial wallets. In contrast, Coinbase may be used
more frequently by users wanting to “off-ramp”, that is, exchanging stablecoins back into
fiat currency. This may also be an expression of the geographic focus of different exchanges.
While Binance has stronger ties to regions with more emerging economies, where capital
flight motives may be more acute, Coinbase has stronger ties to the American market, and
might be better suited for transferring capital into the American financial system.
## 6.3 Dividing Centralized Exchange Flows into Regional Flows
In this section, we enhance our analysis of region-to-region stablecoin flows by assigning a
regional estimate for flows involving centralized exchanges. To achieve this, we allocate each
centralized exchange’s stablecoin flows to specific geographic regions based on the propor-
tion of its stablecoin volume associated with each region. Specifically, for each exchange, we
calculate the percentage of its total stablecoin volume that is transacted with self-custodial
wallets in each region. We then use these percentages to distribute all flows involving the
exchange among the regions. This method relies on the assumption that the geographic dis-
tribution of self-custodial wallets interacting with the exchange approximates the geographic
distribution of the exchange’s users. A key advantage of this approach over the web traﬀic-
based assumption employed by Chainalysis is that it does not assume that CEX users do not
use VPNs and that the average transaction sizes across regions are uniform. In contrast, by
utilizing volume data, our method inherently accounts for regional differences in transaction
sizes. The resulting allocation of stablecoin flows is illustrated in Figure 8. The left-hand
side figure illustrates gross stablecoin flows, while the right hand-side illustrates net flows.
The relative breakdown of the flows is very similar to the breakdown of flows between self-
custodial wallets depicted in 6. This indicates that the interactions of self-custodial wallets
with CEXs, which we have used to assign the CEX flows, is not meaningfully different from
the interactions of self-custodial wallets with self-custodial wallets.
As before, North America and Asia and Pacific are the largest regions in terms of absolute
stablecoin flows, while Africa and Middle East, and Latin America and Caribbean exhibit
larger flows relative to GDP (6.7% and 7.7% respectively). Inter-region flows again are more
important than within-region flows, supporting the narrative that stablecoins are used for
international capital flows and remittances.
25(a) Regional Stablecoin Gross Flows (b) Regional Stablecoin Net Flows
Figure 8: Regional Stablecoin Gross and Net Flows
(in billion dollars)
For net flows, the most significant flow is an outflow from North America totalling
$54.06bn, flowing into all other regions, satisfying some of the global demand for dollars.
Furthermore, the operational mechanics of stablecoin issuance may structurally position
North America as a natural “exporter” of stablecoins. Specifically, (eligible) users—likely
more often located in North America due to greater access to fiat dollars—transfer $1 in
fiat currency to issuers, who then mint an equivalent value in stablecoins. Price stability is
maintained through arbitrage: when a stablecoin’s market price exceeds $1, North American
participants can profitably exchange fiat dollars for newly issued stablecoins and sell them
on secondary markets, reinforcing the region’s net outflow position (see Makarov and Schoar
(2022)).
## 6.4 Country Focus: China
Within this section, we take our methodology one step further to offer country level sta-
blecoin flow analysis for China. The reason we take a closer look at China is two-fold. On
the one hand, China has anecdotally been described as very active in crypto assets, even
though they have oﬀicially been banned. On the other hand, current estimates about inter-
national crypto flows involving China primarily stem from use of the Chainalysis dataset,
which assumes that, on average, users do not use VPNs when interacting with CEXs. An
26assumption that is likely systematically violated when it comes to China. For example, the
website Binance.com is not accessible from China without use of a VPN. In fact, our analy-
sis suggests that Binance is the most important CEX in China in terms of stablecoin flows,
despite being accessible by VPN only.
To distinguish self-custodial wallets between China, and Asia and Pacific (ex. China),
we train an additional model, which achieves 79% accuracy in separating wallets into these
two categories.22
We present all 2024 stablecoin flows that involve China as the receiver or
sender in Figure 9. We begin by describing gross flows on the left hand side of the figure. We
(a) Gross Flows (b) Net Flows
Figure 9: Stablecoin Flows Involving China (in billion dollars)
estimate that stablecoin flows involving China are sizable, with inflows totaling $84.03bn,
outflows of $69.05bn, and within country flows of $4.77bn. Given the small amount of
within-flows relative to in- and outflows, stablecoin flows involving China seem to mostly
facilitate international capital flows, rather than domestic payments. The most important
counterparty for Chinese self-custodial wallets is Binance, facilitating $32.27bn in flows into
Chinese self-custodial wallets, and absorbing $21.00bn in flows from them. It is notable
that the category of “Other CEX” also plays a significant role, while gross flows involving
Coinbase are relatively small. In terms of geographical regions, Asia and Pacific (ex. China)
is the most important counterparty, with relatively balanced in- and outflows of $6.87bn and
$6.74bn respectively. In terms of net flows, we estimate bilateral net inflows of $18.58bn into

We offer more detailed evaluation metrics in appendix D.
27Chinese self-custodial wallets, stemming from Binance ($11.28bn), Other CEXs ($5.78bn)
and North America ($1.52bn). As a percentage of the current account surplus, we estimate
the net inflows of stablecoins into China to amount to 4.4%.23
Outflows from Chinese self-
custodial wallets mostly flow to Coinbase ($3.02bn).
## 7 Economic Drivers of Stablecoin Flows
We further validate our international stablecoin flow estimates by linking them to exchange
rates, which are closely related to some economic drivers (e.g., inflation) that have been doc-
umented by previous research (e.g., Auer et al. (2025)), and also provide further validation—
together with a novel result—by documenting the sensitivity of international stablecoin flows
to systemic shocks, such as the March 2023 U.S. banking crisis.
## 7.1 Link between Stablecoins and Exchange Rates
Stablecoins are typically minted in the U.S., where issuers convert fiat dollars into digital
tokens. Taken together with our previous analysis that showed that stablecoin net flows are
largely outflows from North America. We thus hypothesize that net outflows from North
America to other regions could be linked to demand for U.S. dollars, for example through the
exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar due to a desire to hold US-dollars when local currencies
depreciate. We use our dataset to generate a panel time series of daily net stablecoin flows
from North America to the other geographic regions from January 1, 2022, to December 31,
2024.24
Then, we estimate the following regression:
Net Flows vs NAr,t = β1VIXt + β2Broad Dollart + β3Crypto F&Gt + αr,Q + Weekend + ϵr,t
Here, Net Flows vs NAr,t denotes net flows between North America and region r on day t.
The VIX index is a common measure of market volatility, while the Broad Dollar Index
is a trade-weighted index of the exchange rates between the US-Dollar and several other
currencies. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index (Crypto F&G) captures sentiment in crypto
markets, with higher values capturing bullish sentiment, and lower values capturing bearish
sentiment. We include region-by-quarter fixed effects (αr,Q) to account for regional and
23
We use the current account surplus of $424bn in 2024 from the IMF’s World Economic Outlook in this
calculation.
24
We begin the sample period in 2022, as stablecoins had largely established themselves by that point in
time. In the time prior, stablecoins had been relatively new and unestablished, likely exhibiting different
behavior. For example, the market capitalization of USDT grew from $22bn to $78bn in 2021, while USDC
grew from $4bn to $42bn.
28temporal variation, and a weekend dummy to control for cyclical patterns—stablecoin flows
tend to be significantly lower during weekends. For the VIX and the Broad Dollar Index,
weekend values are interpolated linearly to align with the 24/7 nature of stablecoins and to
avoid dropping weekend observations.
Results. Table 9, left column, shows that a stronger U.S. dollar (higher Broad Dollar
Index) is associated with a significant increase in outflows of stablecoins from North America
into other regions.25
In contrast, we do not find a significant impact of volatility or crypto
market sentiment on net stablecoin flows from North America to other regions.

Note: Residuals in both regressions have been tested to confirm stationarity at the 0.01 level. A further
specification that includes a lag of the flows into the regression can be found in Appendix F.
Next, we extend this analysis to the country level at the example of China. For this, we
create a time series using our China specific estimates, as outlined in section 6.4. The data
consists of daily observations from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. In addition to
net flows between North America and China, we consider net flows between Binance and
China, as Figure 9b indicates that Binance is the most important centralized exchange in

While we cannot attribute causality in the relationship between international stablecoin flows and ex-
changes rates, reverse causality—i.e., stablecoin flows driving exchange rates—seems unlikely given the rel-
ative size of stablecoin flows to overall capital flows.

regression:
Net Flows vs (NA+Binance)t = β1VIXt + β2USD/CNYt + β3Crypto F&Gt + αm + Weekend + ϵt
Results. Table 9, right column, confirms that a stronger dollar versus the Chinese Ren-
minbi (i.e., higher USD/CNY) is associated with increased stablecoin flows into China. As
in the region-level regression, we also do not find a significant association with volatility as
measured by the VIX, or of crypto market sentiment (e.g., the Crypto Fear&Greed index)
for China.
## 7.2 The Disruption of Stablecoin Flows in the March 2023 Bank-
ing Crisis
Next, we further validate our dataset and present novel evidence of the impact of the March
2023 US banking crisis on stablecoin flows. Stablecoin issuers are in the business of inter-
mediating between fiat money and stablecoins. For this, they rely on banks to manage fiat
reserves and to settle the fiat leg of stablecoin issuance and redemption transactions. During
stablecoin issuance, customers have to send fiat to stablecoin issuers, while during redemp-
tion stablecoin issuers have to return fiat to their customers—transactions that have to be
facilitated by banks. The March 2023 banking crisis exhibited failures of several crypto-
related institutions (Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, Silvergate) that provided banking
services to both stablecoin issuers and CEXs. When these banks failed, the fiat currency
side of stablecoin issuance was disrupted. As a consequence, we hypothesize that this shock
caused a distruption in stablecoin flows originating from North America. Using a difference-
in-differences approach, we compare weekly stablecoin flows originating from North America
(i.e., the treated group) to weekly flows originating from other regions (i.e., the control
groups) over five weeks pre- and post-crisis. We set the treatment day to be March 10th
2023, the day Silicon Valley Bank collapsed and was put under FDIC receivership. We
estimate the event study style differences in differences regression:
Flows from Regionr,t = αr + αt +
τ=5 ∑
τ=−5,
τ̸=−1
βτ · Treatedr · 1{τ = t} + ϵr,t
Results (Figure 10, Table 15 in appendix F) show parallel pre-trends, highlighting that the
other geographic regions are reasonable controls for North America. On impact of the shock,
30stablecoin flows originating from North American drop dramatically, exhibiting a decrease of
almost 10 standard deviations relative to controls. In the following weeks, flows normalize,
returning to normal. This underscores the banking sector’s critical role in stablecoin markets
and the disruption that the March 2023 banking crisis has caused for stablecoins.

## 8 Comparison with Chainalysis Dataset
In this section we compare the dataset developed in this paper to the commercially available
Chainalysis dataset that has been used in several papers (Cerutti et al. (2024), Cardozo
et al. (2024), Auer et al. (2025)). Before the comparison, we briefly explain the metholodogy
behind the Chainalysis dataset. To establish the geography of crypto asset flows, Chainalysis
focuses on on-chain transactions between CEXs. To infer the geographic location of users,
they obtain web traﬀic data for these exchanges from the commercial provider Similarweb.
The idea is that the web traﬀic data is a good proxy for the geographic location of the
exchanges users. Consider the stylized example below, which we borrow from Cerutti et al.
(2024):
“Imagine a stylized example with two exchanges, three countries, and a hy-
pothetical transaction volume of 100 Bitcoin from exchange 1 to exchange 2 on
a given day. Based on the web traﬀic pattern shown in Figure 11, Chainalysis
31Figure 11: Example from Cerutti et al. (2024).
would distribute this daily transaction volume as follows: 35 Bitcoin from coun-
try X to country X, 35 Bitcoin from country X to country Z, 15 Bitcoin from
country Y to country X, and 15 Bitcoin from country Y to country Z.”
Embedded in Chainalysis methodology are two main assumptions. First, users do not
use VPNs, which would possibly falsify their geographic location. Second, users from dif-
ferent countries make, on average, transactions of the same sizes, which is needed to split
transaction volumes in equal proportion to web traﬀic. The dataset derived in our paper
relies on neither of those assumptions, which we see as a distinct advantage. In fact, section
6 has provided direct evidence to invalidate the assumption of equal transaction sizing across
regions, highlighting that North American stablecoin flows, for example, are on average sig-
nificantly larger than those of other regions. Further, the data produced by our methodology
allows us to map stablecoin flows between region (and sometimes countries) and CEXs (cf.
Section 6.2), which is not possible in the Chainalysis dataset. In particular, being able to
highlight the crucial role that CEXs play in facilitating international stablecoin flows is a
unique advantage of our dataset. However, the method in our paper also has drawbacks.
First, there are challenges to classifying wallets using domain names and machine learning,
as discussed in section 4. Second, the usage of web traﬀic data by Chainalysis allows for
country level estimates, while our method largely only produces region level estimates.26
To
compare the datasets, we aggregate the Chainalysis dataset from a country level to a region
level, by assigning countries to regions as in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. We then
compare the two datasets along two dimensions. First, we compare the estimated quantities.
Second, we analyze correlations between the two datasets.
## 8.1 Quantities
Prior to conducting a comparative analysis of quantities, it is important to discuss key
differences in the coverage of the underlying data. The dataset derived by our methodology
26
Our methodology can derive country level estimates, such as those for China, on a case-by-case basis.
32encompasses a subset of blockchains, whereas the data utilized by Chainalysis is likely more
comprehensive in its coverage. However, within the blockchains covered, our dataset is
likely more exhaustive. Chainalysis primarily captures transactions that both originate and
terminate at CEXs. To extend their coverage, their “indirect” category attempts to trace
transactions that pass through self-custodial wallets en route between CEXs. This is likely
to only capture a fraction of the transactions involving self-custodial wallets and introduces
additional complexities, complicating measurement.
That said, the overall quantities are broadly comparable, with our dataset estimating a
total of $2 trillion, while Chainalysis reports a figure of $1.7 trillion. Both datasets agree
that USDT exhibits greater prevalence in emerging market (EM) regions, whereas USDC
is more favored in advanced economy (AE) regions. Further, there is agreement that Asia
and Pacific exhibits the largest stablecoin flows, while Africa and the Middle East, as well
as Latin America and the Caribbean, record smaller absolute volumes. Additionally the
direct category of Chainalysis flows also estimates that net stablecoin outflows predominantly
originate from North America, flowing toward all other regions.
The most notable differences relate to the “indirect” category in the Chainalysis dataset,
and the estimates for China. To be able to compare the datasets using a direct and and
indirect category as is provided in Chainalysis, we construct an analog direct and indirect
category for our dataset. For the direct category, we include all direct flows between CEXs,
while the indirect category includes all flows that involve self-custodial wallets (i.e., flows
between CEXs and self-custodial wallets, and flows between self-custodial wallets). We find
no significant disagreement between the direct category in both datasets (cf Figure 12),
regarding the observation that net stablecoin flows are largely outflows from North America
to other regions.
However, there is a severe disagreement between the indirect category in the Chainalysis
dataset and our indirect category. (cf. Figure 13). While our indirect category estimates
that stablecoins primarily flow from North America to other regions worldwide—just as in
the direct category—the indirect category in the Chainalysis dataset suggests the opposite
pattern, with stablecoins flowing out of all regions into North America. The disagreement of
the indirect category in Chainalysis with our indirect category is puzzling, as both indirect
categories likely cover the same underlying transfers of stablecoins between self-custodial
wallets and CEXs. It is diﬀicult to think of an obvious explanation that accounts for this
discrepancy. Looking at the data as a whole, it is notable that all categories, except for
the indirect category in Chainalysis, agree that net flows are largely outflows from North
America to other regions. Therefore, the disagreement of the indirect category in Chainalysis
with all the other estimates raises questions about its reliability.

data
34The next significant disagreement between the two datasets is with respect to China. In
the case of China, significant use of VPNs likely results in Chainalysis methodology capturing
only a fraction of actual activity, which we believe to be reflected in the difference between
the estimates. Our estimates indicate gross flows involving China amounting to $153 billion,
5.5 times larger than the $28 billion reported by Chainalysis, and net flows of $18 billion, a
staggering 100 times larger than Chainalysis’ estimate of $0.18 billion (cf. Figure 14).27

direct)

## 8.2 Correlations
While the previous section has compared the quantity estimates between both dataset, this
section compares the dynamics by analyzing the correlations between the datasets. To
highlight connections to the quantity estimates, we construct time series of daily stablecoin
flows from January 1st 2024 to December 31st 2024. For this analysis, we restrict the
sample to weekday data only, mitigating mechanical correlation arising from the cylicality
of significantly reduced flows on weekends, which is present in both datasets. We begin with
gross flows. First, we document a very large, positive correlation between the outflows of the
27
We provide a comparison of gross flows in Figure 20 in the Appendix.
35respective categories in both datasets, ranging from 0.78 to 0.96 (cf. Table 10).28
Noticeably,
correlations between the indirect categories of both datasets are the lowest.
Region Direct Indirect Direct + Indirect
Africa and Middle East 0.88 0.79 0.91
Asia and Pacific 0.89 0.85 0.94
Europe 0.90 0.89 0.96
Latin America and Caribbean 0.86 0.78 0.87
North America 0.91 0.88 0.95
Table 10: Correlation of Outflows between the Respective Categories in Our Dataset and
Chainalysis
Second, we document that even though the correlation between gross flows is very high, a
more nuanced picture emerges for net flows. Similar to the pattern we highlighted regarding
quantities, there is a high, positive correlation between the direct category in Chainalysis
and the direct category in our dataset. However, the indirect category in the Chainalysis
dataset exhibits large negative (e.g., for Latin America and Caribbean) to negligible (e.g.,
for Asia and Pacific) correlation with the indirect category in our dataset, as well as the
direct categories in our dataset and the Chainalysis dataset (cf. Table 11). This highlights
that the indirect category in the Chainalysis dataset not only disagrees with the direction of
net flows of our dataset (and the direct category in Chainalysis), but also with the dynamics
of the time series.
Region Direct Indirect Direct + Indirect Chainalysis
Direct vs Indirect
Africa and Middle East 0.27 -0.18 0.10 -0.42
Asia and Pacific 0.75 0.01 0.50 -0.13
Europe 0.22 -0.15 0.35 -0.27
Latin America and Caribbean 0.60 -0.38 0.09 -0.47
North America 0.80 -0.22 0.53 -0.39
Table 11: Correlation of Net Flows between the Respective Categories in Our Dataset and
Chainalysis
Finally, we comment on the correlations between inflows and outflows of the regions
within each dataset, as previous research (e.g., Cardozo et al. (2024), Cerutti et al. (2024))
has noted and very high inflow-outflow correlations up to 99% in the Chainalysis dataset.
28
We report the table for the correlation between inflows, which is quantitatively very similar, in Table 16
in the Appendix.
36While we relegate the details to Table 17 in the Appendix, we remark that we find simi-
larly large inflow-outflow correlations to Chainalysis, indicating that they might be a salient
feature of the underlying data. Interestingly, calculating inflow-outflow correlations in
our dataset purely between self-custodial wallets—which is not possible in the Chainaly-
sis dataset—we find that inflow-outflow correlations are significantly lower, although still
high in absolute terms. This hints that high inflow-outflow correlations are particularly
salient for flows involving CEXs, and less so for flows involving self-custodial wallets.
## 9 Conclusion
Contrary to prevailing misconceptions, we find that measuring international crypto asset
flows, while complex, is not impossible. We develop a novel methodology to estimate the
geographic allocation of crypto wallets and employ this approach to quantify international
stablecoin flows. We determine that stablecoin flows in 2024 total $2 trillion, the majority
of which are international. In absolute terms, we observe the highest volumes in the Asia
and Pacific region and North America, whereas we find the lowest volumes in Africa and
the Middle East, alongside Latin America and the Caribbean. However, relative to GDP,
we find the volumes in these regions to be the most substantial. We establish a correlation
between net stablecoin inflows into regions and the relative weakness of domestic currencies
against the U.S. dollar, either suggesting that stablecoins serve as a mechanism to fulfill
global demand for dollar-based assets for people that seek a hedge against currency depre-
ciation, or that stablecoin flows could possibly be sizable enough to drive exchange rate
dynamics. Furthermore, we present evidence of the interconnection between stablecoins and
the banking system, highlighting disruptions in stablecoin flows precipitated by the banking
crisis of March 2023. We believe that our methodology facilitates a wide range of prospective
applications for future research, including the derivation of more granular country-level esti-
mates, the assessment of the geographic distribution of the stock of crypto assets in addition
to flows, and the examination of the geographic patterns of decentralized finance application
usage.

C Identifying Additional Centralized Exchange Wal-
lets
We briefly describe how centralized exchanges structure their wallets. There are 4 different types:
hot wallets, cold wallets, deposit wallets and gas supplier wallets. Hot wallets are wallets that
hold pooled customer funds and are used to send out funds from the exchange to other wallets in
on-chain transactions. Cold wallets are wallets that exchange use for long term storage of funds, are
not relevant for our analysis. Last, there are gas supplier wallets that provide gas to other exchange
41wallets when needed.29 These addresses are present in the dataset that we get from Dune.
Deposit wallets are wallets that are specifically created for customers when they want to deposit
funds into the exchange. These wallets are absent from the Dune dataset. Typically, these addresses
immediately forward deposits into the exchange’s hot wallets and do not engage in any other
activities. We identify a wallet as a deposit wallet belong to a particular exchange if it (1) only
forward funds to hot wallets of an exchange or (2) has receives gas from a gas supplier wallet of an
exchange.
D Model Evaluation
29
Gas measures the computational effort needed to process on-chain transactions. Users must pay for gas
used, typically with the native protocol crypto asset, which for the blockchains in our sample is Ether, except
on Binance Smart Chain which uses Binance Coin.
